waiting in new way low laredo for u.s. authorities to grant her a visa to see her 18-year-old son in san antonio. yami virgin explains he was trying to get to chicago or colorado to help his family get back home. >> yami: maria says she allowed her 18-year-old son to come to the united states with his 24-year uncle. the two would go cross mexico and cross the border at laredo texas. that's where they would jump a trailer that would bring him into the country. his american dream turned into a nightmare on saturday and now this mother is on her way to find her son. today as ramirez waited for word from the u.s. government to see if her humanitarian visa would be approved or not she spoke to a newspaper from new way low laredo. she told them her son had left with his uncle in search of quality of life in the united states. but on saturday night her son's 678-mile trip to san antonio texas took a deadly turn. as close as 100 people being smuggled in this trailer were exposed to high temperatures and no air for hours leaving ten dead and others hospitalized. among them her 18-year-old son and his 24-year uncle whom both ended up in a local hospital. she tells the newspaper that her son just wanted to financially help his family. ramirez was coming to the states to work and raise enough money to be able to marry his girlfriend and allegedly go back to his hometown. the family also says that cerna and his uncle allegedly paid $6500 to coyotes to get on the trailer. that price according to border control forces who provided fox san antonio with previous pictures of cases is higher than what is normally charged. the going rate is between 1000 and $3500 for mexican nationals. central americans are normally charged 5000 to $7000. brazilians 13000 to 18000 and the chinese pay the highest price at 40000 to $70000 to get to the united states. now that mother was granted a humanitarian visa and is on her way to san antonio. her son earlier today woke up from his coma. his

the bexar county jail. that's 15% higher than average. i asked sheriff salazar about it and he says part of it is the result of the railroad of the homeless population. >> the reason they are not eligible for bonding out or pr bonds is because they don't have a reportable address. unfortunately at this point the way the system is set up that's the most appropriate place for them. they are more at risk if you will of disappearing into the wind and then we've got a fugitive at large. >> reporter: judicial services tells me arrests are up due to the work of the violent crimes task force. it's a program that goes after gang members drugs and weapons. >> they are arresting close to 350 individuals a month more than were generally coming in the system. it's probably time to really look at a long-term plan on what we need to do to be more proactive so kids don't become gang members and they have access to services and the opportunity for good jobs. >> reporter: haven for hope and the

before on problems at the san antonio school for inquiry and creativity that have caught the t.e.a.'s attention. michael locklear joins us with the concerns and the next steps. >> reporter: parents are wondering what to do with school so close to starting. the t.e.a. sent this letter to the district the san antonio school for inquiry and creativity as soon as she got this letter the superintendent stepped down. the texas education agency has been investigating the district since complaints surfaced in february and we've just learned t.e.a. found quote the charter school failed to protect the health safety or welfare of the students. and that includes improper food handling in the cafeteria. the agency sasic was operating several unapproved sites and dozens of employees did not complete required fingerprinting and criminal background check process even though for years superintendent said the schools were complying. state agency officials said that put students at quote substantial risk. effective last friday t.e.a. suspended operations and started withholding state funding from sasic. about 600 students do attend the four schools in this district. you can see right

i've been pastor of this church for 29 years and we've seen this. we've seen progress and we've seen things that take place that maybe weren't -- the police weren't even called about. >> reporter: saw says he set up a meeting with the business owner and has had several conversations about crime in the area with police. but he says problems there go well beyond the bar. >> it's very complex around that area. we're moving that building or that business will not just eliminate crime. >> reporter: bottom line he needs more time. >> give him a chance. he's only in there less than a month. but he did say he would work toward doing this and we will hold his feet to the fire. that's why we had a meeting with him the other day. >> reporter: in a statement a sapd spokesperson says officers are working with community leaders church and advocacy groups to address the issues that have plagued the area. >> i would like to hear something more definitive how are you working on it what are you doing what kind of timetable do you have. >> reporter: when asked about shaw's progress at this early stage. >> i'm satisfied that this is one of his priorities. he did show us that. he did demonstrate to us that thissist a priority. >> reporter: and neighborhood leaders say they aren't giving up on councilman shaw. they are trying to be patient and give him more time. they hope to

in washington president trump has refused to sign off on a plan to send more troops to afghanistan. it is reported that trump sent the plan calling for a modest number of more troops back to his national security advisor. last week when president trump was asked about sending more troops he said we'll see. a u.s. army soldier who was pictured kissing the isis flag has pleaded not guilty to supporting the group. he was indicted last friday. court documents claim he met with undercover fbi agents he believed were part of the terror group. he allegedly provided them with classified military information a drone military equipment and training. and a kansas city man who tried to set off what he thought was a bomb at an army post toport isis was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison. he was arrested outside the fort when he made the final connections on the device he believed would arm it. fort riley is the home of the first infantry division. from the terrorism alert desk in washington i'm lindsay mastis. >> announcer: this is fox news at nine. >> ryan: it came down to the wire with the return of senator john mccain but the vice president broke a tie and the senate will move forward tonight on health care reform. we have the latest on the vote. >> on this vote the yays are 50 and the nays50. the senate being equal divided the vice president votes in the affirmative and the motion is agreed to. >> reporter: mike pence broke the tie allowing the health care reform effort to pass its first procedural hurdle. moderate republican susan collins and lisa murkowski reacted. >> we had two republicans go against us which is very sad. i believe now we will over the next week or two come up with a plan that's going to be really really wonderful for the american people. >> reporter: arizona senator john mccain returned from his own health care battle with brain cancer to help gop leadership get to 50 votes. [applause] >> mr. mccain. >> reporter: he received a heroic welcome back and noted there's still plenty of difficult work ahead. >> our health care insurance system is a mess. we all know it. those who support obamacare and those who oppose it. something has to be done. we republicans have looked for a way to end it and replace it with something else without paying a terrible political price. we haven't found it yet. and i'm not sure we will. >> reporter: sources say one idea that has been floated by gop leaders is passing a so-called skinny bill limited to repealing themare's individual and employer mandates and the medical device tax. and then the measure would go to conference to cut a deal with the house. after the procedural vote majority leader mitch mcconnell pledged to keep working to get there and noted democrats struggled with passing obamacare. >> we watched a similar process seven years ago. they had a lot of differences. we're going to sort this out in a thoroughly open amendment process and a situation where 51 votes can change the built. >> reporter: the senate democratic leader tried to convince moderate republicans to oppose this effort. >> don't be fooled by this ruse. a vote in favor of the motion to proceed will mean deep cuts to medicaid maybe even deeper than in the house bill. >> reporter: it won't be an easy lift going forward but leadership was able to get past the first hurdle and will have the opportunity to keep working at it to keep a campaign promise going back seven years. on capitol hill mike emanuel fox news. >> ryan: have you heard about a wisconsin companying giving employees the option to actually implant a microchip allowing them access throughout the office building. it uses radio frequency to attach tags like a door or computer. the company says the implant is encripted but researchers at utsa are developing better ways to protect technology vulnerable to hackers. >> to be able to make that microchip imprintable microchip to be much more safer then i believe we should have their own storage device. >> ryan: the chip is good the size of a grain of rice and it's inserted between your thumb and index finger. >> announcer: now first warning weather with chief meteorologist alex garcia winner of the 2017 ams award for broadcast meteorology. >> alex: that old high pressure was at work today but you know what it released a little bit and there was enough to get these clouds going and a little bit later we were watching the buildup further back out and we've got a couple of pulse storms firing up towards western bexar county and some lucky folks are getting some rain. let's take a look on the world car cam downtown. here's san antonio temperatures we're into the 90s still at stinson. really close at lackland and san antonio but still that is too warm for this time of night. let's get out there see where these storms fire up. they fired up starting to move toward the north. one near helotes one towards the castroville area. a little bit of a signal for hail coming in on some of these. this one here as a little bit of a hail signature but it's week moving away from bexar county but we could really use more rain. we're not seeing much of it coming our way the next few days. here are the temperatures tonight. they are not going anywhere. we're really looking at a very warm layer of spaghetti here. it's going to be 5:00 6:00 in the morning by the time we get out of the 80s and finally make it to the upper 70s. that means tomorrow is going to be a very warm day. high pressure still in control. really going to be sinking. we'll see isolated pockets that maybe something could fire up tomorrow but for the most part it's going to be air sinking and temperatures really warming up again above the normal. and we've seen that for a while. which means the heat index values yeah they are going to get up there close to 105 if not 108 for tomorrow. and we still have some of that african dust which means the air quality still in the moderate category. we're looking for it to settle out by thursday but ""no-txt zone"" comesozone comes up on friday. if you have to water the grass tomorrow your address has to end in a 4 or 5. water before 11:00 or after 7:00. here's the forecast then coming up for tomorrow. same story for early. we're looking 922 by mid-day. 100 or 100 plus. the heat index will be up there near 105 and it's going to be tough trying to cool down in 86-degree water. >> ryan: sure looks nice. if you've just retired or about to doctors say the lifestyle

miking life behind the wheel a little easier. plus change is coming to utsa. who the university just announced as its new president. >> problems we all have them. the first step to dealing with a problem is admitting it exists. it seems that the democrats are taking that first step. >> when you lose an election with someone who has a 40% popularity you look in the mirror and say what did we do wrong. and the number one thing that we did wrong is we didn't tell people what we stood for. >> the democrats do appear to be learning from their losses in the 2016 presidential election. they understand that they have largely fallen out of touch with the american people. a recent poll found that only 37% of americans think the democrat part stands for something. 52% says it just stands against president trump. what is the democratic party to do? apparently it is time for senators announce a new plan. a better deal. better jobs better inch with aes better future. yes the slogan may remind you of a popular pizza chain. >> better ingredients better pizza papa johns. >> there are unique policy proposals. creating 10 million jobs through apprenticeship programs lowering prescription drug prices. there are some strong issues to focus on. the trump administration is already working on some of them. last month president trump signed an executive order to substantially increase the number of apprenticeships in the united states. the administration is also working on plans to address the high cost of prescription drugs. slogans are great but democrats need to connect with american people by action not words. movement on agenda items where the democrats actually agree with the white house would be a good start. some parts of the democrat better deal line up with the policies of the white house so we can actually hope for concrete bipartisan >> ryan: should you accept a money order as payment for items sold online? there's new warnings some could be counterfeit but you can't even tell. fox san antonio's emily baucum explains how con owners are doing their best to trick you. >> reporter: $150 for a large sectional sofa. most consumers use online sites to sell unwanted items. tony posted the items for her mom and dad and was thrilled to get a buyer. >> he asked if it was okay to send a money order. we said it's all right and he said it would be on the pay. >> reporter: when they received the payment the money order was for 900 bucks. way more than expected. >> that sent a lot of red flags and i told my mom not to cash it. it didn't sound right to her either. >> reporter: there were other questions including the payment's post mark. >> we saw it was from kenya which sent huge red flags

ask the seller to return the difference. by the time the banks realize the check is a fake it's too late. >> make sure you trust who you are giving your money to or taking money from on both ends. be aware. >> be careful how you list it and personal information. if something doesn't sound right it probably isn't. >> reporter: emily baucum fox news at nine. >> ryan: postal inspectors are warning consumers not to fall victim to a false sense of urgency. one red flag of counterfeit check or money order scams is when approximate the comment insists something be done immediately. if you are concerned you have received a counterfeit money order you can always take it to the office for verification. >> reporter: robert price at the live desk where a dentist in the houston area has just

gray forest look there's a little bit of rain on that radar and it looks pretty good. nice pop-up storms heat of the day which that happens and we were watching them as they were beginning to get

northeast about 12 to 13 miles per hour. should be in scenic oaks about 10:05. 10:19 near fair oaks ranch. you folks are going to see a little rain tonight. temperaturewise it's still the same trend. we are way above normal going into the next ten days. after that we get a slight cool-down next week so that shows you something is coming on the way to give us a little bit of a break. take a look we've looked back through june and boy it has been above normal five degrees three degrees there. there's only been a few days when we've been below normal and consider normal is 94 or 95. we've been in the mid 90s or the higher 90s for most of the month. that's why it's felt so hot. when is the break coming? we're watching this little thing right here. believe it or not that's going to be part of the break. it's going to circle around and get down into texas and maybe weaken a little bit this big high pressure center that's coming around and we'll see a little bit of an area here that could back up maybe give us a little rain. there's some moisture in the gulf we're hoping comes up a little bit further. so far down in the atlantic and the caribbean kind of quiet but we're watching a couple of waists that waves that are sitting out there. the last numbers are the ones that count. out towards the south that is triple digits over three days. getting out here to thesttriple digits over three days. if you go to the west triple digits. does that tell you what's happening? it's going to be hot and dry and the rain dial is down at zero but the break may be coming up on monday. it may be wednesday on the american model but we do have a break coming. we're not going to be at 100. we could be 90 which is better than 102. chances of rain we'll see a few of them showing up right up as we get into the weekend and that's that break spin around that i showed you. another couple of days showing up and a few more days further. but after that it gets dry and we could use a lot more rain than we see right now. >> ryan: 90 is going to feel like winter sort of. an engineer employed by ford motor company is making a big name at a young age. circa shares her incredible story. >>

creeping up. that means a little extra moisture in the area. we had a few pop-up showers they are heading toward the north and not towards san antonio. comfort index tomorrow still on the high side. boy that dewpoint is going to be high. that means the mold consent is probably going to be climbing up as we see more moisture moving in. here's the forecast as we look at it tough in the morning 79

lucky from their team yesterday after news broke he missed a hearing in that case as well and that turns out he had nothing to do with. the cowboys have been criticized heavily for letting bad behavior from some players go without major consequence. although they won't admit it they jumped the gun. some in the cowboys organization are saying this was the straw that broke the camel's back

that in the best interest of the team to move on there's one thing you can forget about and that is whether you are being fair or whether you've given it consideration of what it means to the individual. that doesn't happen around here. >> chuck: bad timing jerry if nothing else. good influences if your name is la'el collins. a two-year extension worth up to 16 million bucks. that's

hard to make their daily games compelling. a 17-game lead with two months to go in the season. to take on the phils as the astros score first. a triple then on the fly ball. that's a sack fly. then in the fifth here comes another. josh way. jose altuve who got a lot of love today nationally for mvp front-runner scores and it has been all houston tonight out on the east coast. they are up 5-0. it

sitting out and enjoying montague park in wilsonville. it kicked off at 6:30 so just a little more than 10 minutes from now. and we're talking about nate bosford being up on stage this evening. so what a great way to get out and enjoy this warm day that we've had. take the kids out just enjoy maybe a little picnic out there or something but that is our live view from montague park in wilsonville. let's take you out to what that current temperature is right now. those folks enjoying 88 degrees 91 right now for folks in beaverton 88 in forest grove 89 in hillsboro and we're still seeing 90s around mcminnville at 92 yes also are dealing with upper 80s in many spots and estacada has been one of our cooler places holding on to 80 right now. we'll show you you the high temperatures in a bit but i want to get you out and about. this is our view from the unico/u.s. bancorp tower you can see this cloud field that's been moving northward that is from some thunderstorm activity in central oregon. so we'll be watching that but we are expecting things to clear out for us in the overnight hours i think we'll get down to about 62 where we will start for the portland-vancouver metro area tomorrow morning. a little breezy before things calm down overnight. and our brand-new view for you from the ilani casino camera this one looking at mount st. helens there. 88 degrees in ridgefield washington at this time. unfortunately we lost our coast cam which really stinks because i wanted to show you that marine layer coming back in already. we're seeing high temperatures today in the 70s but 60s the farther down you go on the coast. and we're talking about 80s and 90s for the valley locations a lot of 90s and we were expecting to get to near triple digits in the dalles today and that we did. 90 in baker city 94 for folks in the redmond bend area. i think all of us will see a little bit of a cool-down but especially at the coast because as i said that marine layer is already coming back in and we're going to see that for our start tomorrow morning. so low tore mid 50s for the beginning some sunshine in the afternoon i think if you're down on the central coast you're probably going to struggle to break out of some of that cloud cover maybe up around astoria but i think for the most part we're going to see still some gusty northwesterly winds for the afternoon hours. as far as us for the valley locations here's the difference that i'm seeing right now. typically when we get the marine layer coming back in we start to see it sneaking up the lower columbia. i think we will see some of that tomorrow morning it may affect you in kelso-longview perhaps around scappoose and that's one reason why we're seeing temperatures to stay a little cooler for the daytime highs. but also because we'll get cooler air into the picture and overall we're talking about getting back down to the mid 80s instead of those upper o around 90. so for the gorge though it's going to be a little bit of a different story. we're talking about stronger west winds kicking in through the gorge so i think we'll see a lot of people out there enjoying the afternoon hours things may get choppy on the river but all in all upper 80s around hood river after starting around 60 95 still in the dalles so the farther east you go we're still talking about temperatures in the 90s. and again gusts could be in the afternoon hours around the 20 mile-an-hour range so still good kite boarding and wind surfing weather out there for tomorrow with those westerlies. still hot east of the cascades still a chance for some thunderstorms over central oregon maybe far southern oregon like down around burns dehave new fire starts there yesterday. we'll continue to watch the lightning aspect of things over the dry fuels in those areas. but we are okay here in our immediate area. now the next couple days we're looking for temperatures to stay in the lower 80s to firn the week and thursday will still be our coolest day before we heat things up again this weekend and get back up to around 90. we're still dry too. >> steve: coming up tonight how one of the men who died standing up for two muslim girls on a max train is making his mark in one city in oregon. months after his death. >> deb: next why some companies in one of the top spots for bachelorette parties is banning brides-to-be. >> they carry it too far. drunk fall down. being lowrksd obnoxious. >> deb: we have a katu consumer alert. taking a ride with lyft could get afree talk 0. the company is partnering with taco bell for a new feature called taco mode. it routes customers to the nearest taco bell for free taco during the ride. for now you can only try it out in orange county california. the company's hope is to expand the feature nationally next year. >> steve: this is new at 6:00 pay attention debora knapp. locals in one of the nation's businessest party towns says enough is enough and it comes to hosting bachelorette parties. every year hundreds of people flock to nashville tennessee for prenuptial celebrations. but now some tour companies are refusing to drive the groups of women around music city saying the parties get way too out of control. one company called music city rolling jamboree has even banned bachelorette parties from riding their buses. >> you got this set of people wanting to hear a show and then this set of people wanting something different and it just doesn't work out of respect for everyone. >> they're downgrading the fact people are getting married and people are going out and celebrating the fact people are getting married. it's like discriminative. >> steve: music city rolling jamboree owners say they make exceptions if you call ahead. they also say they rarely ever have bachelor parties. >> deb: i don't think they're upset about the celebration part. >>> millenials are set to surpass baby boomers next year as the largest generation of americans eligible to vote. the change will mark the crossing of an historic threshold and a shift that could reshape the balance of political power. baby boomers the largest voter eligibility -- age group since 1978 have leaned toward the republican party in recent years. and millenials tend to vote for democrats. >> steve: microsoft paint is back just one day after microsoft said it wasetting rid of the drawing program. the company says it will be offered for free in the windows store. they decided to keep the program after what they call an incredible outpouring of support and nostalgia. >> deb: more news is minutes away. >>> miraculous story of survival. >> if i knute only way i could get out was to be rescued. >> deb: how a woman says she survived a week in the washington wilderness. >>> and walking the line. why one busy city says people could be safer if jaywalking was legal. >>> plus vacation nightmare. >> they looked at us and said we are sorry to tell you but it's a scam. >> deb: the vacation rental scheme tricking even the most seasoned travelers. what you need to look for mi >> steve: new at 6:00 sheer determination stream

>> mary: 89. right at the last minute we hit 89. we held at 88 for quite some time and then just pumped it up to 89 for just a minute and then that was it we were back to 88. here are a look at the highs we saw today. at the coast absolutely gorgeous i saw a lot of people at the coast today even with temperatures in the 60s the farther down you went. meanwhile for all of us here in the valley locations it was upper 80s for most of us and then 90s if you were around salem or toward eugene 86 in kelso-longview a little bit of a reprieve there. from some of the extreme heat like we saw in the dalles today at 98 degrees. 90 for baker city 94 in the redmond-bend area even 96 in pendleton today. so here's how things are going to go for the rest of the evening. we're going to continue to keep an eye out for some new wildfire starts. we still have a concern about this because we found this one the whitewater fire at mount jefferson 65 acres that started on sunday. the other two new fires started from lightning apparently yesterday. we have of course this one the upper mine fire which is here 2500 acres zero percent contained there are some structures threatened with that. and the bowden fire at 5500 acres just on the east side of highway 95 and that one is just 22 miles south of rome if you're familiar with that sort of part of the state. but we're watching some more thunderstorm activity this evening. in particular what i've focused in on once again is not only near baker city but also this patch here that's been just south of bend around sunriver and also la pine. we're seeing too that we're getting a lot more activity out of this one just to the northeast of klamath falls in the last hour or so so those are my concerns now because we still have these advisories in place for those areas in particular with the red frag warning -- flag warning that will stay with us through wednesday night. we're expecting another round of thunderstorms across that portion of the state for tomorrow as well with dry fuels out there and windy conditions we'll have a fire weather watch that continues in those other areas highlighted in orange. so it is something we are definitely keeping an eye on and thinking about. the other thing that we're seeing are the changes that i have alluded to. we are talking about the marine layer coming back onshore. you can already see it here from our inn at spanish head resort hotel in lincoln city. 64 degrees right now. here's what's happening. overall this upper level low in california has been pushing that thunderstorm activity into southern and central oregon. that low is going to track eastward out of here. we have another disturbance moving into canada the combination of those two things making their move is going to help to move that marine layer back into place bring us that cooler air and that cloud cover for the morning hours so we're going to see a little relief from these temperatures that have been up around 90 degrees. 50s and 60s at the coast to start we'll see 60s maybe 70s for daytime highs still gusty winds at the coast tomorrow afternoon. for us in the valley locations how about upper 70s for southwest washington lower to mid 80s instead of around 90 degrees. we'll take it right? as far as the gorge goes we're definitely looking at some stronger wind conditions in the afternoon hours and my computer has frozen which is awesome meanwhile central and eastern oregon you're looking at a chance again for thunderstorm activity for the afternoon hours and i'll try to get this thing to zip on through. sorry about that. there's your seven-day forecast. staying cooler through friday and we'll pump it up on the weekend once again. >> steve: frozen photographics during the summer. >>> and you have something for blazer fans. >> joe: he had a trade today. they traded alan crabbe to the nets for forward andrew nicholson. the 25-year-old crabbe spent four seasons with the blazers averaged eight points a game during that time. he was drafted 19th overall back in 2013 h. a career average of 41% on three-pointers. the nets signed crabbe to a four-year -- a year ago the blazers matched it. according to espn the blazers will likely waive the final three years on nicholson's contract to ease the luxury tax hit to the salary cap and that's according to those sources. >>> the osu beavers have opened training camp for the college football season. our first chance to see former duck thomas tyner in the osu orange and black. tyner was wearing the number 4 the same number he had at aloha high school. he wore 24 for the ducks. thomas hasn't played football in more than 2 years. the 2015 season was out with a shoulder injury took a medical retirement for the ducks before last season. hi was a high school all-american in aloha and played two seasons with the ducks the 22-year-old tyner is excited and ready to continue his college football career. >> you gotta figure out what you want to do with your life and i felt like i don't like living with what ifs and i felt like the what if was with football for me. and i wanted to -- i didn't want to go out the way i did medically retired but i felt like i owed it to myself. it's fun i missed it. i think it's just more exciting than anything. so i'm excited to get to play this season. >> joe: it's going to be good to see him. >>> meanwhile former duck river darren carrington is going to transfer to utah according to several report. the ducks dismissed carrington from the program earlier this month after he was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of duii. he had several other off-field problems during his team in eugene. carrington has graduated from oregon he's able to play this fall for the utes. >>> and speaking of the ducks they open september 2nd against southern utah and the beavers august 26th against colorado state. so that's why they've opened training earlier because they start the season a little >> deb: can't beat 'em join 'em. where workers are merging with >> steve: in tonight's circular file love that animation. >> joe: i do too. >> steve: you do too joe?

clouds off in the distance. our temperature 9 degreesour temperature 9  degrees. wind out of the south at 8 miles per hour. i am happy to talk about some change. not only in the short term but long-term. we will see a little bit of a cooldown according to the models. tomorrow no. short-term see hot temperaturesshort-term see hot temperatures. tomorrow's highs in the mid-90s.mid-90s. 9 degrees and little or no relief from the rainfall on your wednesday and we have the heat advisory that is in effect and remains in effect for much of northeast central western arkansas and southwestern arkansas an excessive heat warning for these counties where the heat up decks heat advisory index could get up to 110 degrees. [sighing] look at the changes saturday and sunday. where did the 90s go? they have disappeared. and all the models are indicating all over the state the temperatures over the weekend will be in the 80s rather than 90s. you add to that lower humidity. it will make it feel pretty well. shower activity spotty at best over northeastern arkansas. dissipated the last of the showers around the batesville area and the shower and thunderstorm around heber springs. that is pretty much gonedon't think there will be any more redevelopment overnight tonight. the front that we are talking about is still well to the north over the northern plains. south of the frontal boundary a big ridge of high pressure that set up shope of weeks now and left us very very hot and very very humid. now that high pressure ridge looks like it will weaken and push to the west set uphop in the western u.s. and what that will do the circulation around it will replace a southwesterly wind flow and push that frontal boundary not only into the state but through the state as we move into the friday time frame. so late thursday friday and then much of next week as we start august we are going to be seek temperatures below average throughout the region of our country which will be a nice change. not only that could see some rainfall. the european model is indicating a quarter of an inch to half an inch and the gfs model is indicate a little bit more south central arkansas some areas could see an inch as that frontal boundary moves through. cooler weather drier air and rainfall. a winning situation here we have going today. right now temperatures around the midsouth are very hot. 93 degrees at little rock. 94 at hot springs and arkadelphia. 96 degrees at fort smith. factoring in the humidity. and we have triple digits just about everywhere with the highest triple digit reading at106 degrees at searsy nothing much tonight and nothing much on wednesday as far as futurecast is concerned. go to go to the north where the frontal boundary will finally be making progress southern missouri out of northern arkansas. 5:30 thursday afternoon scattered showers and thunderstorms moving south and they dissipate overnight only to redevelop on friday as that front moves farther south through the entire state. how does it play out. the forecast this way 76 degrees. partly cloudy. warm and humid. and then 96 tomorrow with hot and humid conditions and a heat index reading around 106 around the metro gray and the forecast gets better. 40% chance of late-day thunderstorms on thursday and. and then again on friday a 40% chance. and those temperatures slide down with highs in the 80s and lows in the 60s for the weekend and into early next week. and after a couple of weeks of low to mid 90-degree temperatures it will feel nice. >> beth:  great weekend. >> ned:  holding continue to what the models are saying and they are in agreement. >> beth:  thanks a lot ned. >>> arkansas children's hospital opening new clinic. >> chris:  find out what services will be provided and when it will be located next. >>> arkansas children's hospital is opening a new clinic in southwest little rock today. >>

school football in arkansas and for teams that are really good have worked hard and are on the rise championship caliber teams which we think all of them are for them to play in a big-time atmosphere early in the season is a good experience for them and the coaches say it kind of gets you ready for the playoffs and play at war memorial in december. >> obviously the publicity we get on the field is great but really draw us to the hootens and blue cross and blue shield classic is what they do in our community. it was like 10000 meals we have been able to provide for our food shelter last year and

mental health. the d.a.'s office reacted to the sentencing and why jail time wasn't included in the sentencing. >> and if he had been sentenced to prison he would be released very soon after this. so this way rather than not have him paroled he gave him probation in order for him to have that strict monitoring over him. >> he was arrested three times back in 2016. once for allegedly being high while on duty and two separate times for incidents involving his wife and mother. >>> kids are being credited tonight with helping to create a new skate and bike park. make that a reality. organizers held an opening ceremony for the park today. it's called the digorgio action park. city leaders say after an old skate park was shut down for safety reasons the kids started gathering signatures consulted their neighbors and presented the plans to the city council. the mayor says this is one of the ways the city is becoming safe and healthy. >>> we're trying to provide more recreational activity for the youth and the community. the parks should be a safe place for the families to be active and healthy and have fun and that's what we have for arvin. to have a safe community where we could be active and healthy and improve the quality of life. >> the skate park was made possible thanks to a partnership between several groups. the toni hawk foundation and building healthy communities. >>> coming up here president trump wrapping up his attacks on jeff sessions. what he said about the attorney general today. >>> it was cliff -- it was a cliff hanger today. a look at the tense day in washington. >>> and hot weather across much of the state. it'll be getting warmer before it gets much cooler. on his own attorney general today. >>> the president continued attacks on his own attorney general today. president trump is frustrated by jeff session's decisions to recuse himself into the russian meddling. this morning the president chose to revive an old campaign issue tweeting sessions has taken a very weak position on hillary clinton's crimes. >> i want the attorney general to be much tougher on the leaks from the intelligent agencies which are leaking like rarely have they ever leaked before at a very important level. these are intelligence agencies. we cannot have that happen. i told you before i'm very disappointed with the attorney general. but we'll see what happens. time will tell. time will tell. >> speaking at the white house the president would not say whether he intends to fire sessions. >>> a moment that came down to the wire with an emotional return of senator john mccain at the center today. the vice president's breaking the vote. the senate moved forward on health care reform. >> on this vote the ayes are 50 and the nays are 50. the senate being equally divided the vice president votes in the affirmative and the motion is agreed to. >> mike pence breaking the tie today allowing the republican health care reform effort to pass their first procedural hurdle. it was that close because moderate republicans susan collins i should say voted against even debating the issue. sources say one idea that's being voted now by the gop leaders is to repeal obamacare and the medical device tax. then that measure could go to conference to cut a deal with the house. >>> congressional democrats have announced a new economic agenda to try to reconnect with voters on lowering health care costs and limiting corporate mergers. our chief political analyst weighs in with his opinion. >> problems we all have them. the first step to dealing with a problem is admitting it exists. it seems the democrats are taking that first step. >> when you lose an election with someone who has say 47% popularity you look in the mirror and say what did we do wrong? the number one thing we did wrong we didn't tell people what we stood for. >> reporter: the democrats do appear to be learning from their losses in the 2016 presidential election. th understd they ve largely llen ouof touc with the american people. a rece nbc ws waington postole found ly 37% of amicans thk the mocrat party stands for something. 52% says it just stands against president trump. what is the democratic party to do? apparently it is to have a mix of ten senators and representatives drive 65 miles west of washington d.c. and announce a new plan. a better deal better jobs better wages better future. yes. the slogan may remind you of a popular pizza chain that rhymes with palacios-hernandez  john -- papa john's. there are some policy procedures creating 10 million jobs. lowering prescription drug prices setting new tougher standards for corporate mergers. there are some strong issues here to focus on. actually the trump administration is already working on some of them. last month president trump signed an executive order to substantially increase the number of apprenticeships in the united states. the administration is also working on plans to address the high cost of prescription drugs. slogans are great but the democrats do not need to connect by action not words. movement on agenda items where the democrats actually agree with the white house would be a good start. some parts of the democrats better deal will line up with the policies of the white house so we could actually hope for concrete bipartisan agreements. not good luck. that's the bottom line. >>> coming up here immigration problems are arising in all parts of the world. now libya is facing some of the events on its own. >>> thousands of water fountains are going dry in italy including some at the >>> anything new in the weather department miles? >> the fact that there is. it is something that just came back a few moments ago and it is kind of an interesting scenario but it might take place. right now take a look at this beautiful shot. he was at topaz lake right before you go in fact right on the california-nevada border. south of gardnerville. this was the smoke from the death line of the fire whichcontinues to burn about 79000 acres. all the smoke was going way off to the north of us. outside we're at 86 degrees with a nice evening all in all. today's high is 100. this morning's low is 75. everything visible by 25 right here as you can see and it's heat wave number three. heat wave number three continues because we had a high of 90 today. 99 most other spots. currently we're at 86 degrees with temperatures in the mountains. their cooling trend would continue for one more day. that would be tomorrow. then after that all bets off. any way the dew points are okay right now in the mid-50s. we had some thunderstorm activities way off to the north with the dry air coming in thanks to the low pressure system coming in here. they bring rain and stuff but now it's bringing dry air and right over the top of us. something not so dry down to the south you can take a look at all of this tropical activity. this is pretty much done now. hillary is a category two hurricane. some interesting things will happen with these hurricanes in the eastern pacific. notice hillary is going to be moving north fairly quickly. and then they get sort of caught up. right here they are beginning to orbit around each other. but some brand new information shows interesting things with that. i'll show you that in just a second as we'll continue to see the thunderstorm activity mainly out to the east of us. not too much else going on. it's cooling us off just a little bit. you'll see in the american model here this is hillary. hillary comes right to our coast this little low right here. it won't be a hurricane or a tropical storm. in fact it probably won't even happen. but just looking at it here it comes literally right into bakersfield. so hillary is coming to kern county. probably what will happen they will die out in the eastern pacific. temperatures are 99 for the high tomorrow. and it looks like in fact heat wave number three could continue. i have it continuing until the 8th or 9th of august. in the mountains we will be a little warmer for thursday and friday. there is a slight chance for thunderstorm activities on tuesday and wednesday. unless the model is correct then all bets are off. >> do we really need to vote again? how does it work? >> a quarter of the world's refugee population lives in africa. and reports reveal smugglers are using libya as a transit co >>> immigration is -- more than a quarter of the population lives in africa. and smugglers are using libya to get refugees to

hold them accountable. you don't even have a legal system in many cases that allows you to provide the protection refugees need. >> reporter: they use libya as a path to safety in europe. >> i was

possible. i haven't been to the future to come back to a report yet but i can n tell you what it looks like. we'll be looking at warmer weather after tomorrow for sure. in fact it'll be a moderate

( laughter ) i do not have the words to describe what i'm about to talk to you about. it's like describing a new color that you've never seen before. and this color is made of all the other colors dying. like if a rainbow got gangrene. first let's talk about the senate and what they did today. you know how the republicans have been trying to repeal and replace obamacare? well since trump's been in office they've tried three times and they've failed. ( cheers and applause ) but they finally figured out why they failed. they failed because people knew what was in their bill. ( laughter ) huge mistake. so today they raised the bar on lowering the bar okay. here's what they did. senator majority leader and raiders of the lost ark with his face melting mitch mcconnel on the new health care bill but: >> we don't know whether we'll be voting on the house bill the first version of the senate bill the second version of the senate bill. >> this is a miserable terrible process and nobody's happy with it. and we're being given no information. >> there is no one who knows. >> stephen: the bill the bill was a total mystery. it's like ""westworld--"" no one knows exact plea what's going on but it's probably going to be a bad thing for women. ( laughter ) and this total lack of information nobody knows nothing. was not a mistake. it was the plan. because if none of the senators know what they voted for it's potentially both good and bad at the same time. it's a black box we can't see inside. it's schrodinger's healthcare. ( laughter ) but the cat is probably dead because it doesn't have health insurance. but mitch mcconnell assured his colleagues it was safe to vote for it. >> if it were to pass without any amendment at all this is two-year delay before it kicks in. so the takeaway from what i'm telling you is no harm is done by getting on the bill. >> stephen: yes! that's the senate's hippocratic oath-- first do no harm... for two years. then we'll see what happens. they held the vote today. and the motion to debate the bill passed. which means they now have 20 hours of debate to fine tune the bill that they did not write for the past seven years. it should be fine. they don't know the big stuff like it will be printed on paper and that's it. so that's profile in courage number one. the second gobsmacker of the last 24 hours was donald trump's appearance last night at the national boy scout jamboree. it's no surprise he went to the boy scouts. with all his scandal he's good at putting out fires. you're too kind really. now obviously this is an event for children from all over the country and it is completely nonpartisan event so trump left the politics behind and just talked about his hopes for their future. i'm just kidding. ( laughter ) he did his thing. >> boy you have a lot of people here. the press will say it's about 200 people. ( laughter ) it looks like about 45000 people. you set a record today. ( applause ) >> stephen: you know they were going to be there anyway right? ( laughter ) it's their event. not yours. ( laughter ) ""i can't believe all these people turned out for the super bowl just because i'm here. i'm also i've got to say-- and i'll say this-- i'm very honored that there are seven billion people on earth right now. it's a new record. just to see me. weren't that many yesterday. every day."" ( cheers and applause ) ""just to see me."" and of course trump knew how to work that crowd. >> the united states has no better citizens than its boy scouts. >> stephen: take that girl scouts! ( laughter ) ( applause ) >> jon: wow! >> stephen: the boy scouts are known for their love of civic engagement. we have boy scouts in my family. we have an eagle scout in my family. one of the nice things is they do badges on the government. donald trump took the opportunity to drop a deuce in that punch bowl. >> you know i go to washington and i see all these politicians and i see the swamp. and it's not a good place. in fact today i said we ought to change it from the word ""swamp"" to the word cesspool or perhaps to the word sewer. >> stephen: ""kids i come here to inspire you: your government is a festering river of human waste and i'm the madman who rules it on a throne of turds."" ( laughter ) ( applause ) >> jon: oh! >> stephen: okay? biggest ever. >> jon: oh! >> stephen: unbelievable absolutely i don't-- as they say i don't know. after introducing actual former boy scout energy secretary rick perry trump explained to the boys what a great job his administration is doing. >> and very soon rick we will be an energy exporter. isn't that nice? >> stephen: ""okay kids who wants a merit badge in fracking? anybody?"" then he introduced another member of his cabinet: >> secretary tom price is also here and he's doing a great job. and hopefully he's going to get the votes tomorrow to start our path toward killing this horrible thing known as obamacare. by the way you going to get the votes? he better get them. he better get them. oh he better-- otherwise i'll say ""tom you're fired."" >> stephen: ""i'll fire him right now! i'll fire him right now. kids who wants to see a grown man cry? anybody. come here squirt him. come on squirt him."" trump than began citing the scout law: >> as the scout law says: ""a scout is trustworthy loyal""-- we could use some more loyalty i will tell you that. >> stephen: we could use more loyalty!essions weren't enough poison to pour into the ears of children he told them this story. >> and he was a very successful man became unbelievable-- he was a home builder-- became an unbelievable success and got more and more successful. and he did this for 20 years and then he was offered a lot of money for his company and he sold his company for a tremendous amount of money. and he went out and bought a big yacht and he had a very interesting life. i won't go any more than that because you're boy scouts so i'm not going to tell you what he did. ( crowd chanting ) should i tell you? should i tell you? oh you're boy scouts but you know life. you know life. >> stephen: ""yeah you're boy scouts but you know life you know billion airs. international waters. no witnesses. gambling. cock fights. some ladies. everyone's wearing loose clothing. i forgot where i was going with this. anyway work hard kids."" then trump laid out his bold vision for the future: >> and by the way under the trump administration you'll be saying ""merry christmas"" again when you go shopping believe me. ( applause ) merry christmas. they've been downplaying that little beautiful phrase. >> stephen: yes they are downplaying it for some reason. i'm just spitballing here. maybe it's because it's july. i don't. ( cheers and applause ) i don't--. ( cheers and applause ) and now that they've heard from the president the scouts have updated their oath. let me just-- ( clears throa on my honor i will do my best to make a tremendous amount of money and buy a sex yacht like that old guy the president knows to keep myself physically strong with golf and steak and refer all questions to outside counsel. merry christmas!""

( band playing ) ( cheers and applause ) >> stephen: welcome back everybody. jon batiste and stay human right there. give it up for the band right there. >> jon: thank you. >> stephen: folks i never said-- this is something. i'm about to say something i never thought i would say. >> jon: what's that? >> stephen: but i am worried about attorney general and shocked grandma jeff sessions. because donald trump has been ripping into sessions all week. just this afternoon he said this: >> i am disappointed in the attorney general. he should not have recused himself almost immediately after he took office and if he was going to recuse himself he should have told me prior to taking office and i would have quite simply picked somebody else. so i think that is a bad thing not for the president but for the presidency. i think it is unfair to the presidency and that is the way i feel. >> stephen: yes trump feels that's bad for the presidency. he's afraid is might lead to impeach-ment. and that's just the latest. yesterday trump tweeted ""so why aren't the committees and investigators and of course our beleaguered a.g. looking into crooked hillary's crimes and russia relations?"" he's got a point. he's not looking into hillary's ties to russia. and during the debates we know she met with known russian sympathizer donald trump three times! shared the stage with him. that's not right. something doesn't smell right. so if trump hates sessions so much if he doesn't trust him why doesn't he just fire him? well according to cnn's chris cillizza trump doesn't actually like to fire peoe and ""wants to make sessions' life so uncomfortable that sessions throws up his hands and walks away."" trump's like a bad boyfriend who who's too scared to break up with you and who's daring you to break up with him. ""oh looks like you caught me in bed with your sister. also sorry i forgot your birthday i was too busy selling your jewelry for drugs. so you ready for dinner?"" trump has plans to replace sessions and has floated names like former new york mayor and embalmer's display model rudy giuliani. >> audience: boo! >> stephen: and he's even considering his former rival ted cruz. well of course! you know you want cruz at the head of justice. we all remember how trump spent the campaign calling him ""truthful ted!"" now obviously this puts jeff sessions in a tough position and today one of the attorney general's friends even told reporters ""sessions is totally pissed off about it."" and you could tell because every time sessions gets angry the bells on his little curly shoes start ringing. in fact he's so angry he's i'm honored to say that he's here tonight to address the issue publicly. ladies and gentlemen please welcome the attorney general jefferson beauragard sessions. ( cheers and applause ) >> mr. president have you no sense of decency sir? if you are going to disparage my good reputation at least have the courtesy to do so to my face at my enchanted tree. i am double-stuffed with indignity! ( laughter ) now i will not surrender. i stand firm... on the outside. on the inside i am creamy fudge sir. i shall never be replaced! oh no! oh no! it's rudy giuliani! quick! quick! quick stephen. quick stephen. hide me in your mouth! gone. we'll be right back with charlie rose. ( cheers and applause ) r. when it comes to hitting perfect drives nobody does it better. he's also into oil painting. looking good. but when it comes to mortgages he's less confident. fortunately for rickie there's rocket mortgage by quicken loans. it's simple so he can understand the details and be sure he's getting the right mortgage. apply simply. understand fully. mortgage confidently. fo summer sales event is in full swing. shovel. mulch. brick pavers. fence posts. concrete. we're good. and wood for my castle. we got it. and a slide and a drawbridge. take on summer right with ford america's best-selling brand. now with summer's hottest offer on ford f150. get zero percent for sixty months plus an additional thousand on top of your trade in. that's the built ford tough f150 with zero percent for sixty months plus an additional thousand on top of your trade in. offer ends soon during the ford summer sales event. how was your vacation? hey guys what's this tomato doing at randy's desk?

""this will create a lot of smaller sites and different opportunities for renovating that a small investor can take advantage of"" standup the proposed changes have locals here excited for what could come justin meccia kalispell ""it would tap into that pulse that i believe each and every one of us especially those who are downtown residents like myself really are craving"" they want new energy but not at the expense of history.

on the fourth. he was found dead strapped into a restraint chair. the records were unsealed. huff was placed in the chair for an extended period of time and not given enough food water or medical treatment or conditions he was suffering from. his family recently sued the sheriff employees and the county saying that he was only given one meal in the two days he was in the restraint chair and that because a previous arrest the jail should have been well aware that he needed medication for heart disease and depression. osi helped to investigate the case and bring in the six suspects after they were charged. the district attorney who represents garfield county decided he will not be the one who tries this case. he decided to recuse himself because of his close relationship with the

county fair continues through saturday night at 10:00 in myrtle point. >>> a bit of a toasty day across the state of oregon with 90s seen pretty much everywhere. portland didn't quite get there. 89 degrees. mark. down in medford a high temperature of 99 degrees. so close to the 100-degree mark in ontario. certainly seeing some thunderstorms across the region as well. still down around the same spot as yesterday southern -- the deshoots counties into northern klamath and lake county. these showers and thunderstorms staying with us for a couple more hours before they diminish. the mountains will hold them out to the east. douglas county probably not picking up any rainfall from those thunderstorms as they do stay on the eastern side to have mountain. but we are seeing the fire danger to expand a little bit. one place that has gotten better is across klamath and lake county. yesterday was high fire danger and they picked up a lot of rain. the extreme danger across central oregon has expanded south close to medford. that is now under extreme and high fire danger up in the -- up and dun the oregon cascades. so things are dry. things are hot. and of course that increases the hire danger we have around the region. we also have this red flag warning. that continues until tomorrow. the red flag warning any flames that start can expand very very rapidly in these conditions so any lightning with those thunderstorms across the county are a bit of a concern because they could spawn some of the thunderstorms. otherwise dry in washington dry across western oregon and that's how the next few days remain. there is not much change on the way and the big reason why is this high pressure center. we're working on close to two months now. it continues to send warm dry air forcing the jet stream off to the north which means any storm system hits the jet stream and then is carried up into canada where it misses us entirely so no storm system headed our way at least in the short term. the next seven days remain very dry all across the pacific northwest. overnight tonight some clouds do return to the region. the coast is 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning as we begin our day. you head to work and you will wake up under a bit of gray starts tomorrow. those cloud doss not last for too long. by about 10:30 the sunshine moves on in. we'll see sunshine all day long with the temperatures in the mid 80s. we won't be quite as warm as we were today as the few clouds tomorrow morning will block the sun for a few hours to start the day which means temperatures won't be quite so toasty for our wednesday. highs here in the 60s for many locations. florence in the 60s as well. south coast more sunshine maybe a little bit of fog here and there. north bend at 69 degrees. seven-day forecast the oregon coast 70s just around the corner. sunday and monday. oregon coast. the umpqua valley a warm day. more clouds. not quite as hot as where we were today. that is the morning cloud cover we'll see and will keep us warming up  much. don't worry plenty of 90s in the forecast. saturday and sunday will stay in those low 90s. the willamette valley warm and nice tomorrow. a little bit cooler. mid 80s on the way. starting off tomorrow a bit on the gray side but by 10:30 11:00 the sun does come right back out again. >> it is a nice forecast. it looks great. >> oh yes. certainly dry still. >> thank you travis. >>> grab a popsicle because it is not going anywhere. >>> sky mule ser next the beavers return to practice... . ú>> the beavers return to underway. their used to be a duck. on day one all eyes on a play kval's preston hiefield is in corvallis with the latest on the new runningback in town. preston? >> reporter: the face of the osu program right now is certainly the running back but it is a different oregonian in the beavers' back field that has everyone's attention. formerly retired and recent duck thomas tinier is back on the roster here in oregon state. she practicing with the team today at day one of fall camp. he isn't wearing his jersey number 4 just as he did in high school at aloha and he was running strong today in even though the beavers were just in shells. the ex-duck explained his return to college football. he told us he didn't want to live a life in what ifs and he didn't want to end his college football career with medical retirement. that is why he is back in the pac-12 with oregon state. >> and you have to figure out what you want to do with your life and i felt like you know i don't like living with what ifs and i felt like the what if was with football for me and i wanted to -- i didn't want to go out the way i did medically retiring but i felt like i owed it to myself. it is fun. i definitely missed it. i think it is just more exciting than anything so i am excited to get to play this season. >> he told me after practice today that if he wasn't playing college football right now he would be a lumber brokeer in bend oregon. talk about a what if. live outside preston hiefield sky back to you. >> thank you preston. multiple reports indicate the former oregon wide receiver darren carrington is headed to salt lake city. ute zone was first to report that carrington is officially joining the utah utes following a duii arrest. carrington was dismissed by the ducks' head coach but since he graduated from oregon he is eligible to play right away for a different school as a grad transfer. utah comes to oregon october 28 interesting and exciting although this is not yet confirmed by the university. so we should know in the next 24 hours if this is official and legit. >> all right. thank you sky that is it for kval news at 5:00. >> the ""cbs evening news"" is next. we'll see you at 6:00. your brain is an amazing thing. but as

myrtle point for the coos county fair. >>> the weather in and around the coast including myrtle point looks very nice. maybe a few clouds and fog the start off the day. as we have seen a lot of for the postmonth the fog and %-clouds burn away quickly. there is sunshine around the region. here is a look at where we were today. certainly a toasty one for many spots. portland did not quite get to that 90-degree mark. eugene today at 91. corvallis right at 90 degrees. cooler on the coast in the 60s. we do have some showers and thunderstorms making an appearance across southern oregon. clay math and lake county seeing heavy of rain and plenty of lightning as well. this is where the majority of the storm activity was yesterday dumping a lot of rain which actually helped to diminish the fire danger now. right now under a moderate fire danger where yesterday we were at a high. we have had other location where is that fire danger has expanded. around medford under extreme douglas county lane county a high fire danger and things only look to remain dry and really only look to remain hot as we head throughout the remainder of the work week and into the weekend. so no real change in that regard. on top of it we have this warning. this is a red flag warning which essentially means that any fire or smoldering flames that begin will spread very quickly. the conditions are very dry and just ripe for the fire to expand with quite a bit in just a little bit of time so any lightning strikes down across douglas county or lane and klamath countyno it is best thing in the world for us this evening. satellite and radar we have this high pressure center sitting off the california coast. it is the same one that has been there for two weeks now. it has forced the jet stream to the north which means any storm system hits this jet stream and is redirected way up north into canada missing us entirely. all that is left for us is the warm dry air. we have seen extremes of this. other times it will be impressive and that is where our temperature also vary. overwhelmingly dry with no rain in site. you see that that here in our model forecast. we do have an opportunity for a few clouds to move in tomorrow morning. this is 8:00 a.m. waking up potentially a bit on the gray side as we start off our wednesday. it doesn't last for too long. by 10:00 11:00 a.m. at the latest. we stey sunshine move in. any showers that exist across the region will stay in the eastern portions of the state central and eastern oregon. temperature force the coast back where they were this afternoon. and florence a around 68 degrees. a few spots waking up with the morning clouds the morning fog but they don't last too terribly long. getting into sunday monday on the seven-day forecast here some 70-degree heat ton way for the oregon coast. the umpqua valley a warm day. clouds around the region sitting in the 80s. umpqua valley will be in the 80s and we see the t 0 -- 90 back into the area a look at the willamette valley forecast not quite so warm. mid 80s and the 90s return. we'll see them sunday and monday. nice and dry with a few clouds but certainly no rainfall. >> all right. thank you travis. >>> we're coming back with sports right after we the beavers return to practice... . practice as fall camp is >>> the beavers return to underway as is usually the case. the talk of camp vons the quarterback position. and kval's preston hiefield is in core value wis the latest on the quarterback situation. preston? >> reporter: hey sky. it is no secret that oregon state has been one of the worst passing teams in all of football since gary anderson took over at osu. now it is up to a trio of quarterback contenders to help turn that around. now luten's 6'7"" frame and -úsuccess at the junior college level a year ago makes him the favorite but anderson won't tip his hand towards a favorite you yet. he said that ideally he would maim name a starting quarterback today if he could but because it would help further define the team's identity but con day in to camp none of the candidates have hti to separate themselves from the rest. >> we need to throw the ball more effectively. we did stick some routes down the field which was great to see. we had four or five deep balls the field and a very limited throw package now. there is not a 4r-9 oh lot of offense as the throw game goes. they seem to have pretty good command of the offense playing with the type of pace we want to play so it was a solid day but again there is so little offense right now that it is hard to nog the big picture. >> reporter: i spoke with luten after practice today. remember he threw 40 touchdowns at the junior college level a year ago. i asked him about the difference in talent between the j.c. level and the pac-12 level he said it was noticeable but not overwhelming. all three took reps but they only got to watch 20 minutes of it so it was tough to tell who is a clear favorite and coach anderson said we're not take far along into fall camp so the corp tissue rages on. i'm preston hiefield let's go back to you in the studio. >> thank you preston. it should be fun to follow that quarterback competition. we didn't have time to get it t.o. it but the willamette valley baseball team they went 6-0 in regionals. they're going to the cal ripken world series in indiana. >> all right. congratulations. >> no kidding. >> thank you for watching kval news at 6:00. >> we'll see you back again tonight for kval news

privacy rights. that narrative was misleading. in thea of 2016 the fairfax county issued new internet privacy rules. some question the rule's legality. the federal trade commission had jurisdiction over internet privacy. the rules required internet service providers implement an opt-in policy on data collection. customers have to consent before cable companies can collect or disclose their data. this includes browser history app usage and so on. existing law prevent the sharing of data tied to an individual. it must be anonymously bundled with other users. but not everyone had to abide by the same rules. there was a car of carve out for edge providers including google facebook and similar services. they were given a very lax policy. consent to collect or share data was automatically granted unless the user opted out. the fcc was picking winners and losers. this spring congress nullified the rules before they went in to effect. privacy protections today are the same as they've

year: mark stoops: ""we took our lumps a year ago in particular early in the season and then we grew for it and got better. i think you're going to see the fruits of all that work this year. it's nice we have nine starters that played significant time last defensviley coming back. we expect to see a big improvement. make sure we simplify it in certain ways. there's always a fine balance between being as complex as you can be with execution. it's nice to have some experience on both sides of the ball."" mark stoops is eager to get his team on the field... that will happen this weekend as the cats begin fall practice... stoops addressed the annual kickoff luncheon at noon today at the stadium through the summer the coaches are not allowed to be on the field with the players... they work on their own. but stoops admitted today he is able to get a little glimpse of what's going on: mark stoops: ""fortunately not by design of course but we can look out on the practice field from our offices. yeah you never noticed that? yeah darndest thing but you can look out on the practice field. i just peeked once or twice but i would never violate any rules like that tom. but when you do

think we were second fewest penalties in the national football league which is one of our key elements. turnover ratio we were in the top five of that and those are things we did very well. we did not make enough game-winning plays in all three phases and that's the biggest difference. we've got to stay healthy we've got to make please when it counts and that's how you win."" the high school football season starts in 24 days and we continue our previews. mercer county went to the class 4-a region finals a year ago. but they have some rebuilding to do. year two under david buchanan saw the

couple.coach david buchanan - mercer county: ""d smith soaked up our obvious on believable and he was really like the quarterback on the field it was really a big factor in our backyard he's not there so now everybody else's so we got to figure out what's going on in and we're making progress in that regard."" gunnar gillis is back at qb and he has a year under his belt in mercer's complicated offense. aaron johnson - mercer co. receiver: ""he was our leader. he's definitely the person we look up to and he's a pretty good quarterback so so i asked receivers can trust him whether were open or not to get it to us."" defensively is a strength and an area which needs improvement. the pass defense had 26 interceptions last season but the run defense at times had struggles. trevon faulkner - mercer county safety :""that something we have to get better at because last year it was kind of a struggle. i think this year we have a bunch of tough guys and young guys who like to hit and whatever else so i think will be fine."" mercer county is physically stronger which is one of the biggest improvements and coach buchanan says another run in the post-season is certainly attainable. coach buchanan: ""i want to get to november either with the best team on the field or having a chance to win and i think that's very realistic for this team. i think we've got enough weapons and i feel like we can get there."" with the mercer county titans bm wkyt research on 202 former football players found evidence of a brian disease in nearly all of them... from the nfl down to high school. the

wasn't as lucky as i was to be born in a town like cynthiana."" suns guard brandon night has suffered a torn acl and is expected to miss the entire upcoming season... knight tore the knee playing

bill. the chamber held a nail-biting vote today to start a debate on the legislation. c-n-n's ryan nobles has more on how majority leader mitch mcconnell was able to round up votes from senators who previously opposed the bill. tonight- senate republicans have pulled off what even a week ago seemed impossible. vice president mike pence / no name font necessary: ""on this vote the yays are 50 and the nays are 50. the senate being equally divided the vice president votes in the affirmative."" securing enough g-o-p votes to bring a bill to the floor and begin debate on dismantling obamacare. sen mitch mcconnell r majority leader: ""we can't let this moment slip by. we wrestled with this issue. watched consequences of the status quo. people who sent us here expect us to begin this debate."" but it wasnt easy-- even up until the last minute the majority leader was whipping republican votes. mcconnell held a very animated conversation with wisconsin's ron johnson on the senate floor - just moments before johnson cast an affirmative vote. nats mcconnell also secured support for this stage of the vote from skeptical senators like dean heller of nevada rob portman of ohio and shelley moore capito of west virginia.. and he needed the help of senator john mccain who made a dramatic return to the senate floor. natsot applause just days after being diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer. while mccain voted ""yes"" today mccain warned his colleagues the current process was doomed to fail. sen john mccain r arizona: ""let's see if we can pass something that will be imperfect full of compromises and not very pleasing to implacable partisans on either side but that might provide workable solutions for problems americans are struggling with today. what have we to lose by trying to work together to find those solutions?"" but while the successful vote to proceed was a big win for mcconnell the real war over healthcare is just beginning. lawmakers will now begin the fight over exactly what theill ultimately become. sen. ted cruz r texas: ""for many senators - myself included - it depends on what the final bill contains. that's essential in doing your job as a senator."" it means that the final bill could go in a number of different directions. they could strike a grand deal to repeal and replace obamacare. they could vote for a straight repeal one that some conservatives favor but will start the clock and up the pressure on finding a full replacement. or they could pass what's being called a ""skinny repeal"" - a bill that strips out some of the major aspects of obamacare but leaves many of the provisions in place. getting the vote to floor also opens to door to democrats to offer up a flood of amendments that would likely fail - but would force republicans on the record in a number of key areas. sen chuck schumer d minority leader: ""the best the majority leader's been able to cook up is a vague plan to do whatever it takes to pass something anything to get the bill to a house and senate conference on health care. my colleagues plain and simple it's a ruse."" pj simple it's a ruse."" pj democratic senator bernie sanders called

the long term. this would separate somewhat drier air over north ga from deeper moisture central. however...not expecting the air mass to become dry enough to remove rain chances for any length of time. a stronger wave of energy dropping from the great lakes to the mid atlantic states should push a another front to the tn valley on friday.the front should continue to push into central ga over the weekend. there are some signs that this front could push through the area over the weekend bringing in some slightly cooler temperatures and lower humidity. it is rare for a front to push all the way through middle georgia this time of year so how far south it goes is still to be determined. thanks jeff.ahead on wgxa news at 5..if you're a pet owner... you may have a health advantage.when we

first day of football practices all across the state hitting the field for the first time this summer today. plus are the braves out of the playoff picture? we'll take a look in sports. welcome back. senior citizens with dogs may be at a health advantage. regularly walking a dog boosts physical activity levels of older people especially during the winter. a new study shows  dog owners are active for thirty extra minutes per day on average over people without a dog... but everyone was less active if the weather was cold or wet..  overall.. dog walkers still were more active no matter what the weather. study authors say it is normal to be less active as we age.. and don't recommend everyone own a dog... since not everyone is able to take care of a pet...  but they do suggest these study results could lead to new programs to support daily activity. thanks mason.chronic traumatic encephalopathy -- or c-t-e -- is a progressive degenerative brain disease found most often in people with a history of repeated brain trauma.the c-t-e center at boston university says anyone who endures regular concussions or subconcussive hits to the head can be at risk ... and that includes athletes especially football players. a new study published by jama found chronic traumatic encephalopathy -- or c-t-e -- in a high percentage of former football players whose brains were donated for research... including 110 of 111 national football league players. researchers with boston university's c-t-e center examined brain tissue donated by 202 deceased former football players.they found the condition in 87-percent of men who played for an average of 15 years ... including high- school college semi- professional and professional play.86-percent of professional players diagnosed with c-t-e had a severe form of the condition/symptoms of c-t-e may not appear for years. they may include memory loss impaired judgement impulse control problems and aggression ... as well as depression anxiety and suicidal impulses.some studies have linked cte to parkinson's and lou gherig's disease researchers acknowledged the limitations of their study -- it was based on a brain donation program designed for those who fear they suffer from c-t-e.but the article concludes that the high proportion of c-t-e evidence found does suggest it may be related to - quote - ""prior participation in football. i woke up this morning with a little extra pep in my step..why..because today is the first day of high school football practice. teams all across the state hit the field..some in the morning and some in the afternoon to begin their respective journeys towards a state title. from forsyth to cordele..thomaston to dublin..today is the unoffical start to the football season in the 478.     tonight on wgxa news we will begin previewing some of our local teams and how they are preparing for their seasons. three teams under the microscope this evening..the tattnall square academy trojans fresh off of a region title and a state semifinals appearance.     the stratford academy eagles..another trip to the playoffs for them last year..and the mary persons bulldogs..a team only two wins from a state title in 2016. be sure to tune in tonight to hear from the coaches on what they expect from their 2017 seasons.     the braves are still on the west side of the united state..they started a series with the arizona diamondbacks last night and it didn;t really go according to plan.     10-2 the final in phoenix..braves starting pitcher r-a dickey only lasted three and two thirds innings and gave up four runs on five hits.     it's been a struggle for the bravos the past week or so..they were very much in the hunt for the final wild card spot..but after getting swept by the cubs and now dropping three games in a row..they are starting to look like the playoffs just aren't in the cards.     the atlanta falcons report to flowery branch tomorrow so let's look at some of the biggest story lines for the team this preseason.     a big question mark is the contract status of running back devonte freeman. freeman has one year left on his rookie deal worth 1.8 million dollars..which is a steal.     freeman is a two time pro bowler who has proven himself in this league..especially last season rushing for over 1000 yards and 11 touchdowns..he was a key cog in the machine that was the falcons offense in 2016.     general manager thomas dimitroff has said that signing freeman to a new deal is important to the franchise. a big surprise that has come out of cleveland the past couple of days..star point guard kyrie irving doesn't want to play for the cavaliers anymore.     friday espn reported that kyrie irving asked owner dan gilbert to trade him..it was rumored that irving no longer wants to play second fiddle to lebron james. despite reports that lebron james wants kyrie out of cleveland as well..king james took to twitter today to voice his displeasure with those reports..calling them hashtag not facts.     big ten media days taking place this week in chicago..today the michigan wolverines and head coach jim harbaugh were in town to take the podium. harbaugh was in macon earlier this summer for a satellite camp hosted by bobby lamb and mercer.     the some would say eccentric coach always seems to offer up some sort of wisdom in his press conferences and today was no different.that's all for sports..we'll have more for you coming up later on tonight. for now we'll send it back over to the desk. thanks mason...one georgia highway saw more than just car traffic.next on wgxa news at 5..why one plane had to make an emergency stop. but the plane on the road wasn't the only reason commuters stopped in their tracks. we'll show you after

we now know that women is in critical condition but the officer is stable. in other georgia news..the pilot of an amateur-built airplane walked away from an emergency landing near atlanta

vacation area of middle georgians may be getting a fun new feature.the georgia island authority will start doing free test runs of a trolley service on jekyll island.that's right.. that trolley service will run between beach village and the historic district for the next two weekends... and the whole reason for offering this new service? because business owners.. residents and visitors asked

wave of energy extending through central georgia will continue to serve as a  catalyst for convection through this evening and again wednesday.  expecting these showers and thunderstorm to continue through this  evening and then dissipate by midnight. will see another round of  redevelopment tomorrow afternoon as the main area of moisture and the trough does not move much over the next 24 hours. the highest rain chances tomorrow will again be across central ga in the vicinity of these aforementioned features. a few thunderstorms could become briefly strong or severe during peak afternoon/evening heating with locally damaging wind  gusts and heavy rainfall being the primary concerns. a surface boundary will extend across central ga at the start of the long term. this would separate somewhat drier air over north ga from deeper moisture central. however...not expecting the air mass to become dry enough to remove rain chances for any length of time. a stronger wave of energy dropping from the great lakes to the mid atlantic states should push a another front to the tn valley on friday.the front should continue to push into central ga over the weekend. there are some signs that this front could push through the area over the weekend bringing in some slightly cooler temperatures and lower humidity. it is  a front to push all the way through middle georgia this time of year so how far south it goes is still to be determined. fresh cut grass..whistles..and up downs..it can all only mean one thing..football is back. high school teams across the state got their first official practices under their belts today which means we are only three weeks away from the first games of the 2017 season. tonight we start to preview some of our local teams gearing up for the year..we start with the tattnall trojans.     over on trojans trail..tattnall entering it's second season under head coach chance jones. going to be tough to follow his opening act..a perfect 10-0 regular season..regional title..and a trip to the state semifinals..not bad for your first head coaching job mr. jones.     the trojans are a great team..but they have some question marks this season. they lost a lot of starters to graduation..big names like ahmad barron..christian rogers and jimmy marshall.     jones knows they have an inexperienced team..but he thinks his team will be able to build off of their successful season last year. <<<""i definitely think we're going to be able to build off of it. it will be tough losing those 16 seniors we had for that last group and it was a great year it was a great first year. hopefully coming in the second year everyone will be a little more comfortable with the system and be able to take everything a little bit further. i think the younger guys have to step up that were sophomores going to be junior and even some freshman going to be sophomores that didn't get a lot of playing time except for maybe on some special teams. have to be able to step up and play one way or even both ways at some point."">>> the trojans start their region title defense on august 25..that's week one against wilcox county. they start regional play in late september. one of the trojans biggest competitors in the region..the stratford academy eagles. they had an 8-4 2016 before getting bounced by tattnall in the second round of the playoffs.     they lost some big names as well..quarterback noah hill and lineman david matlock..but stanford committ tobe umerah returns on that line and is a force to be reckoned with. coach farriba has never been a coach to set the bar low..so a region title the goal on peake road..and hopefully a shot at a ghsa state title.     but coach says it's important for the message to his team to stay the same every year. <<<""i think our message is really the same every year. we don't want to be on some sort of roller coaster where one time we're here and one time we're down here and whatever. we just want to try to perform and practice at a level that we think is necessary every single day. regardless of circumstances or outcomes what happened this year or last year or whatever. we want to be very consistent day in and day out."">>> the eagles start their 2017 campaign on the road against savannah country day on august 25th. these two teams will probably be fighting for the region title along with a couple of other teams this year.     here's a look at how this tough tough region shook out in 2016. tattnall the winner..right behind them was twiggs county..cobras were very talented last season. there is stratford with a 3-2 record in region play..in front of fpd who was 2-3..watch out for the vikings. wilkinson county and mount de sales looking up at the rest. braves and diamondbacks playing game two of their series tonight in arizona. scoreless right now in the third. mike foltenevich on the mound tonight for the braves. that's all for now but coming up later..we have one more

exchange seen on police surveillance video. the officer told investigators that the chief took an aggressive stance and called him nothing but a two-bit punk. allegedly saying ""come on tough guy. make a move. hit me. come on."" the report and video released today by cranston four days after pelagio was placed on paid leave by providence mayor charlie lombardi. the i-team reporting that this incident and its aftermath has the chief in hot water facingdisciplinary action. >> get out now! please get out! >> reporter: pelagio faced criticism for how this incident went down in 2015 when he

pelagio at first tried to file assault charges against cranston officer but backed off when he was told the video showed no assault. was that the tipping point for his boss? mayor lombardi is not talking. for now the chief is off the top with pay... off the job with pay. >> gene: parker thanks. all right. new at 6:00 now one of the poster boysol for clergy sex abuse in boston gets out of

including a few storms that have moved on through east flat rock. they are continuing to move southward along highway 85 crossing the state line and we do see that one little area of moderate rain there. future radar shows over the next couple of hours these isolated showers and storms could continue to move out of the mountains on into the upstate and i know many of you would welcome a shower to kind of ease that heat that we're feeling right now. we do have cooler changes coming. bigger picture shows this area of mild high pressure will begin to work in with the front moving south of our region that's going to allow this cooler air to move down from the north kind of behind that front so tomorrow we'll feel the changes we're going to only be in the lower to mid 80s so that will feel better. we do have a slightly better chance of rain not a washout but we do see these hit-or-miss showers by 6:00 tomorrow evening and then we are also keeping our eye on this second front which is going to move closer to us on thursday and then really begin to cool us down as we head into the weekend. plenty of rain and cloud cover out ahead of it and on friday we are going to drop back down to around 80 degrees and we're going to stay in that mild pattern on through the weekend. so as we go through the evening by 8:00 we still have that chance of a few pop-up showers. they go away once the sun goes down leaving us with areas of patchy fog partly cloudy skies. tomorrow morning you may have to deal with a bit of fog on your way into work. by the afternoon we see a few showers and storms

about a 30 percent chance showers and storms and we do stay in the mid 80s on through the middle of the week but then we drop back into the lower 80s as we head into the weekend. right now it looks like friday could be an unsettled day with a good chance of showers and storms but that wraps up on saturday morning leaving us with a pretty good looking outdoor weekend saturday afternoon and all

sighting of stroupe last night about 8:00. a caller told law enforcement officers he wasn't sure if it was in fact him but the description matched what he saw. he saw a person heading south on mills

move out of the area. a couple of hours ago we saw a number of investigators here in this area. we're at the ingles just off 280. we saw a helicopter circling this field a number of times. we also see investigators driving through this area. and 1.1 investigator got out with a gun drawn. didn't appear to see anything or find anything what they were looking for so got back in the car and continued

""the people of wisconsin did not send me to washington to take people's health care away. we should be working together to make things better not worse. let's work to stabilize the market make health care more affordable and take on drug companies and rising prescription drug costs."" as soon as both the senate and house agree on the same version of a health care bill it goes to the president. if the senate changes the house version in any way.. it goes back to the house. if the house makes any changes then a joint house-senate conference- committee would have to work-out a compromise. president trump celebrated today's vote at a rally in ohio. he spoke to a crowd of supporters in youngstown. the state of ohio helped trump win the election in november. during his speech the president applauded republican senators for moving forward on the repeal and replace of the affordable care act. we're now one step closer to liberating our citizens from this obamacare liberating our citizens from this obamacare nightmare and delivering great health care for the american people. the president's speech also focused heavily on illegal immigration and jobs. a three-day prostitution investigation in oshkosh netted 20 arrests. police say that includes one woman who officers say brought along her 3-month-old infant. the mother was one of six women arrested for prostitution along with one man those seven all are from milwaukee. police say the baby was turned over to a relative. investigators also arrested 13 men from appleton oshkosh kaukauna and neenah for solicitation of sex. police are investigating an attempted carjacking and beating in a milwaukee suburb. the victim told our milwaukee partner station today that a man wearing brass knuckles blindsided her as she got out of her car to go shopping friday in greenfield. the victim says while she was being beaten...a women tried to get in her car on the passenger side but couldn't because it was locked. about then she says she remembered she had pepper spray inside her purse. he is still attacking me. i spray him directly in the face and i dont lay my finger off the pepper spray until i see him crouching down rubbing his eyes police are still looking for the suspect and a person of interest. just before the attempted car jacking investigators say a retail theft happened a couple of miles away in greendale but they are unsure if the two events are connected. and we're on storm watch tonight... thunderstorms are possible in parts of our area tomorrow... even tonight... patrick joins us now. i saw some flashes of lightning in the sky this evening. showers and storms return to the area over the next day or so but a longer stretch of pleasant weather appears to be on the horizon. skies will be mostly cloudy tonight with scattered thunderstorms developing. tomorrow brings more humid conditions and temperatures push into the low 80s. scattered showers and storms continue as a cold front approaches the area. the scattered storms continue into tomorrow evening with heavy rain the main threat from these potentially slow- moving cells. lows drop to 64 degrees as skies become partly cloudy later that night. the packers' titletown district continues to strive for better health. a ceremonial ribbon-cutting this morning for a medical clinic... fox 11's pafoua yang takes us for a tour. with just three big sizzors nat- ribbon-cutting and one quick snip...the bellin health titletown sports medicine and orthopedics finally came to life. doctor patrick mckenzie has been waiting to open these doors since the the day he moved to green bay in 1989.

""yeah well...i'm getting bit."" ""i must of had at least 20 bites on my back."" ""and the water has no where to go as you can see it ponds it just sits there."" burlington was one of several communities hard hit by recent flooding. damage to public roads bridges and dams in southern wisconsin is estimated at more than 15-million dollars. and -- many crews in wisconsin's logging industry are trying to make up for lost time. recent rain-free days are providing a break from soggy conditions that bogged down operations in parts of the northwoods. fox 11's eric peterson reports from oconto county on the 3-billion dollar a year wisconsin industry. deep in the woods of the chequamegon- nicolet national forest the worst is yet to come i think. matt huempfner says four-wheel drive is the only way to go. huempfner is a forester with wild rivers forestry. he says treads are needed so this 50000 pound tractor called a forwarder can move around this site near lakewood. but huempfner says getting the timber out of the woods is a different story. the trucks come in weighing about 98000 pounds on their way out. so it's really it's pretty hard for them to get in and out of jobs where if you have any type of moisture in the ground. huemphfner says logs are stacked up wherever there is room. the longer our product our wood sits in a pile the longer it's drying out. and we get paid by the weight so it really affects our bottom dollar that way. and it's more than just northeast wisconsin. timber experts say the soggy conditons stretch across much of the northwoods affecting the bottom line of many logging operations in the region. i've actually checked with a few and i'm hearing 25-30 percent they're down in their gross income from a year ago even. henry schienebeck says some loggers are covering their costs by taking wood now that was earmarked for harvest next year. so next spring comes. unless there's more timber that's put up for sale on drier ground they're going to be in a world of hurt then. back on another site in oconto county the wild rivers crew was on the move. for the first time in about two months a truck full of timber was headed to the mill. we'll keep whittling away at it. whenever we get a couple days of dry weather together we'll try to haul some wood out. in oconto county eric peterson eric peterson. -- logging experts say they will haul the timber as long as the weather

((barbara mckinney ""they come into this space with an added burden. not only are they talking about what happened last week they're also talking about the reality of what happened early this morning."")) mckinney says she hopes the turnout reflects that this neighborhood has what she characterizes as -- skin in the game. as madison's gun violence problem becomes more urgent -- each passing day.

dakota area that will continue to track its way into thursday. let's see on futurecast we will be dealing with the next couple days. wednesday looks like this putumayo not so bad for hump day. we will see some cloud but we run a very small chance of dealing with showers. that is the key: showers. not even likely to be any heavy downpours out there. that changes dramatically thursday because it is at this point we see heavier rain return. and for the northern tier a spot that does not need any more rain we are likely to see more of it on thursday. but that is just the beginning. we are also likely to see a pretty potent line developing at this point in the afternoon prime heating of the day around 5:00 or so we will see a likely wave of strong thunderstorms sweep across the region. eight

rain thursday and friday. are you expecting as much as we got in the last previous days? > mike: you know as far as us seeing somewhere near five inches of rain like we saw in denton on monday i don't suspect that being the case mainly because you look at that temperature fluctuation. there is no huge discrepancies. so yesterday we set temperatures in the mid to high 80s today low 70s. a huge drop-off. morcom the next few days but still likely to be pretty wet. >> dayne: mike thank you. >> ryan: but first how will you know our team? you can follow us on facebook and twitter. it's a >>

tie statistically for the hottest days of the year. normally. so normal high temperature for this day is 79 and we were nowhere near there today. tomorrow i think we will be in the ball park some towns and 80s at the coastline and near 80. now we are tracking clear skies and lows will be in the 40s and 50s. 50s at the coastline and 40s over the interior and notice clouds departing today that was the old orchard beach pier cam and a live look at portland and things are quiet. lows again most towns in the 50s. low to mid-50s. there will be candidates for 40s. areas like fryeburg sanford may slip into the 40s as well. and sheltered mountain valleys will be in the 40s early tomorrow morning similar to what we had saturday night. storm tracker will start us tomorrow morning. you will wake

at the coastline. an on-shore wind with a sea breeze the beaches will be cooler than inland towns. now thursday there is a little bit of a question mark on thursday. based on my forecast i think we will see clouds on thursday with rain showers. and most of that action should be the midday and afternoon hours. thursday is probably the unsettled day in the forecast. but it is worth mentioning if we see sun on thursday that is going to destabilize the atmosphere that we could see the thunderstorms. regardless we will get wet weather on thursday. do we rain showers or the chance with thunderstorms. we will go with rain showers with highs in the 70s. sun we see could produce thunderstorms. something we will watch. that is 5:00 p.m. on thursday. now the major change from today to yesterday's forecast that storm system on friday looks as if it's going to stay too far south. instead on friday now i think we will see a decent amount of sun with highs in the 70s and low 80s. that storm system still will develop and it looks like it will track too far south. may see high thin clouds with that on saturday. beach forecast looks good. upper 70s. an on-shore wind developing low 70s by the afternoon. on the water the small craft advisory should be dropped and seas two feet and visibility reduced and early morning fog. and thursday a question mark and do we get showers or thunderstorms? i think we are get plain old showers with a lot of clouds. sun we will be warmer as well. friday and saturday we should be in the 70s to near 80. inland towns are warmer during that period. and in the extended we could be talking about mid-to upper 80s on monday. something for everyone but the lion's share is looking nice. compares to where we have been and a lot of clouds. >> we need a summer stretch. >> bring it on. wrapping up it. july is about to end. now cbs13 and fox 23 present the on your side pet food and adoption day. sponsored by... >> food and forever homes today

why you thought it was a good idea to come after the new girlfriend i had nothing to do with it. >> the affidavit says police found a car matching the one in the video. he was arrested monday at portsmouth regional hospital. but attorneys agreed he can be released on personal reconnaissance. as long as he wears a gps monitor gets a mental health checkup and has random testing for drugs and alcohol. >> we look at whether or not there are conditions which can assure the safety of the community and we believe the conditions can accomplish that. >> lamont's attorney says he is not a threat to the public. >> he entered a plea the not guilty and we need to see the evidence and take it from there. >> prosecutor say the next step in the case is to present it to a grand jury. marissa bodnar fox 23 news at 10:00. >> a connecticut man is accused of breaking into a locked apartment and attacking people inside with a walking stick. early monday morning 40-year-old colin phillips entered an apartment in farmington with a walking stick and got into a fight with people inside. police say they were able to get phillips out. he was hospitalized and later taken to jail and released on $5000 bail. >> this just in the scarborough education budget has now failed for a second time in as many months. the town's voters rejected the budget by 83 votes out of 3800 votes cast. town leaders will have to try again before the new school year begins. >> in winthrop residents passed their school budget 465 yes to 210 no. >> there are mixed messages in manchester new hampshire tonight. pan handlers are asking for money and above them city signs urging the drivers to give the money to charity instead. the police chief says this is to fight the drug crisis. >> during the evening commute on elm street a man holds a sign reading homeless please help. while standing in front of the city's new sign that tells drivers your generosity could lead to a fatality. please donate to a local charity. it lists places to go for food shelter and help. this man will not talk on camera but tells us not everyone is an addict. some people just have hard times. manchester police say they are concerned because between 2015 and june this year 24 people involved with pan handing overdosed. six of them died. >> the large majority of that population are feeding an addiction or have an underlying mental illness to give them $5 and potentially lead to i a fatal overdose. >> and the organizations listed on the signs agree saying give to them. if you really want to help. >> i think it is a great idea. i hope people listen to it and think of what is behind the sign. you know let's get people into organizations that can help them up and out. >> some drivers open their windows and wallets in front of the new sign and others are heeding the advice. >> these guys walk up to your window and hold that sign in front of your face and make you feel guilty and who knows what they do with the money. >> the city is saying that money should be steered to organizations that can help. an update on our your side car safety seat check. safe kids maine inspected 47 vehicles and found 94% were misusing car seat restraints and provided 14 car seats. a lot of lives potentially saved. we thank safe kids maine and the families who participated. >> next no joke companies putting microchips in employees. >> what it means for more than 50 workers. >> and a great looking weather forecast is on the way for wednesday. we're still tracking wet weather for part of thursday. we will look at the late-week forecast and the storm and let you know how close it will come u.s. cellular has unlimited data and got rid of hidden fees. now's your turn. [ blows whistle ] move it go go go! didn't we just get rid of that? sure did! but activation fees pop up all the time. again?! yup! every time you upgrade your phone. why does this keep happening? because you added a new line. and it looks like someone just got a new phone! that was me. sorry guys. darien: get iphone 7 on us with no activation fees. only from u.s. cellular. low 70s in portland and the wind will turn on-shore. inland i expect temperatures near 80 or low 80s returning. that is one of those days the farther inland you are the warmer it is going to be. do we see sun thursday we will see the thunderstorms develop if we do not see sun and keep the clouds in place we will have rain showers throughout the day and cooler temperatures. regardless we will see wet weather on thursday. and starting off 7:00 a.m. most towns will be in the low 60s tomorrow. we'll see a lot of sun. a nice sunny day in southern and central maine and we are going to top out in the low 80s over the interior. 70s at the beaches and 60s that might be a little bit too cool but you get the idea the closer to the coastline the cooler you will be. and early morning fog should burn off quickly. this brings in clouds early thursday and that is 7:00 a.m. i have to agree. i think we will see cloudy skies to start the day and rain showers developing but again if we s s develop that will destabilize the atmosphere enough to bring in afternoon showers and thunderstorms. regardless thursday is going to feature wet weather and wet weather in the form of showers throughout the day. and high temperatures will top out in the 70s. a storm system should track to the south friday and saturday. based on that scenario we would see sun on friday. that is about 10:00 a.m. friday. and by the afternoon more warming to near 80 for a lot of towns. remember yesterday we were talking about the potential of a storm system coming close enough to bring a lot of wind and rain for friday friday night and saturday? well the newer information today is still suggesting the storm is going to form and it's going to bring a lot of rain to some areas but not here in maine. it looks too far south to bring a major impact but traveling in southern new england and new york these areas have the best chance of seeing the rain and wind. any shift in track could significantly change our forecast. but you do not see a big storm like that develop in late july heading into august. your forecast for tomorrow we should have highs upper 70s low 80s and the wind turns to the south. so south wind cools things off at the coastline. thursday is the wet day and on and off showers that day. and the question is do we get thunderstorms? i think it's on and off showers. friday 70s. and monday begins the next warm-up. and inland towns are a little bit warmer tomorrow and next week. that is a look at the forecast back to you. >> democrats announced a new agenda to try to reconnect with voters. creating jobs and lowering healthcare costs and limiting corporate mergers. boris epstein a former trump campaign senior adviser and white house official provides commentary on the democrats new agenda and the possibility for bipartisan support. >> problems. we all have them. the first step to dealing with a problem is admitting it exists. it seems that the democrats are taking that first step. >> when you lose an election with someone who has 40% popularity you look in the mirror and said what did we do wrong? and the number one thing we did wrong we did not tell people what we stood for. >> the democrats appear to be learning from the losses in the presidential election they understand that they have largely fallen out of touch with the american people. a recent poll found that only 37% of americans think the democratic party stands for something and 52% says it stands against president trump. what is the democratic party to do?

cbs 6 news with steve lapointe the weather authority. >> day two of this unseasonable chill. 66 so far at albany. say so far because the clouds have thinned a little bit. probably not get to 60 which is the previous record low maximum. sitting at a record right now for july. 63 north adams pittsfield 62. bennington 63 right now. there are spots even cooler but again with thinning in the hudson valley saratoga has now popped up to a whopping 67. really really cool certainly for this time of year. checking out albany you can get a sense that the clouds have thinned or maybe broken a little bit. this is the east green push location. 63 at least at the east green bush facility. drizzle and light showers especially back here in the western catskills. otsego delaware and ulster counties. this north/northeast flow converging and plus the higher terrain is acting as a lifting mechanism so that's squeezing out extra showers for you folks. gradually we should see things drying out. this upper level trough of low pressure pulls off to the east and that should allow high pressure to briefly build in for a time late tonight and especially tomorrow. under the high the sun came out and where the sun came out the temperatures did respond well into the 70s around 80. that's the air that's going to be here tomorrow afternoon. tomorrow does look much better than today with at least partial sunshine and milder conditions kind of kick the murk out at least temporarily. low 50s to around pittsfield mid hudson valley with lower to mid-50s back to the schoharie valley and the western catskills. we'll burn that off and see sun. clouds will then tend to bubble up especially over the hills and mountains. enough sun to get the numbers up to between 75 and 80. a slight chance that there could be enough instability for a popup shower especially across higher elevation locations western new england. the catskills up into the adirondacks. here's the hudson value lyrics don't think we'll see any showers here but surrounding the hudson valley there could be that popup shower. a 20 25% chance you will get one during the afternoon. if you do it will be fairly brief. a lot better than it was today and a lot better than it will be on thursday. the clouds are back as a series of fronts move on in. in fact showers could touch off a break with intervals of sun and as the cold front approaches scattered downpours and thunderstorms will crop up. a couple of rounds of wet weather likely for us and some of this rain could be locally heavy in spots. the front could be a little slow too which could allow showers to persist especially south of the capital region through friday morning. the best bet for the weather would be thursday and those locations drop off especially over the weekend. passing through our south to keep us cooler through saturday. sundayks brighter a little warmer near 80 with low 80s in here coming up monday or tuesday. once we break the back of this pattern thursday into friday morning. we should see a couple of nice days here with dry weather conditions setting up in time for the weekend. >> all right nothing wrong with that. like the weekend weather. >> absolutely. coming up once again the colonial athletic association's media day. >> and a great danes record continuing to put points on the board. brittany is in next with sports. getting screened for breast cancer just costs co-pays are high - and insurance has deductables. the cost is always an issue. new york state leads the nation making breast cancer screenings cost-free --- no co-pays deductables or other costs. screenings are free for nearly all women --- even if you have no insurance. and early detection saves lives. now there are no excuses. and no cost to me. get screened. no excuses. go to n y dot gov slash get screened >>> with just over a month to go before ualbany football kicks off in baltimore today for the annual caa media day. each was able to bring two players and it's no surprise. running back elijah was among those to earn recovering from an acl injury he suffered late last season. >> making cuts again getting out of bed learning how to walk how to cut again. before you can learn everything physically you have to get your mind ready to do those things to get back into it. >> before eb was dominating the run game at ualbany there was drew smith. the full back out of guilderland was the most prolific sport in school history. smith spent the summer of 2013 with the buffalo bills before suffering what was a career ending injury. for his accomplishments on the field smith was one of 14 players inducted into the hall of fame this saturday in albany. he got the call from known other than paul ford. i was in a meeting and he wanted to book me and who better to do it. it was great just wow. after a while made a little sense to me. >> drew tells me what he's doing now he considered his dream job. what is it? you'll find out tonight when our few interview ends if the yankee's game doesn't go too long. >> that's a tease. i want to know. >> me too. >> trying to think what it could be. >> he should be doing tv. he's got a great personality. >> probably coming after my job. >> thanks brittany.

don't feel the humid air until that dew point gets 60 or above. we have widespread 50s to right around 60. relative to the weekend where it was beyond pea soup it's so nice. i know some of you might like sticky air but the winds are calm. they will stay that way. light and variable winds. a few clouds floating by. a few more off to the eastern side. places like cambridge caldwell back over to morgan county and perry county you have more clouds than say london up through marysville and over toward hardin county as well. that will stick around but these clouds will go away tonight. we will show you futurecast shows you these clouds passing by. then things kind of dry out. maybe some patchy fog tomorrow morning if you are by a river. any body of water a lake or something like that. otherwise i expect sunshine tomorrow. at 5:00 tomorrow do not forget your sun screen. tons of sunshine. no threat of rain tomorrow going zero percent. temperatures will be warmer but the humidity shouldn't be out of control. tonight looking out over 670 state route 315 traffic is not backed up per se but heavier. 74 at 7:00. 71 by 9:00. 67 at 11:00 tonight. tomorrow we will go 60s again in the

in the forecast. no change on thursday. still tracking that shower and storm potential. i think we have plenty of clouds. most likely an overcast day dropping our temperature a little bit. the biggest change today is that system that's coming through will have what's called wrap around moisture. that's lingering showers throughout the day on friday.  so i have included that on our friday. the weekend still looking delightful. 79 82 respectively if you are traveling out doing anything including the fair rounds of golf camping that type of stuff. great weekend for that. we will be watching

coming over the next week. here's where we were on the almanac and we did hit a high of ninety three degrees a little bit above average a trace of rain at the airport and we have a surplus going now for the year of one point seven two inches of rain but some areas have seen much more than that and have even more of a surplus going for the year. temperatures across the state mainly in the mid upper seventies but we do still have a few low eighties sprinkled in haiti to myrtle beach eighty in orangeburg greenville the hot spot again tonight and eighty seven degrees as we get a look at live doppler radar it looks a lot worse than it is most of this is not even reaching the ground maybe a few showers down toward the savannah river. but most of the rain is back into georgia and then we've got a little shower here in the upstate but most of the rain has dried up. now what we're looking at is just some moisture in the atmosphere some humidity not actual rain that's reaching the ground.

but it looks like most of that rain has already dried up and we'll just keep the clouds around overnight tonight then tomorrow a mixture of sunshine and clouds some scattered thunder showers will be possible and our highs holding a little bit below average tomorrow because i think the clouds get here a little quicker and will see some slightly higher chances for rain will keep those rain chances

since june first fifty two percent of the days we've had at least a trace of the rain so that almost every other day we've had some rain and that's starting to add up at the charleston international airport where looking at a surplus now almost an inch and three quarters but downtown charleston for the year this isn't an issue first this is for the year almost ten inches of surplus and we've still got more rain on the way so at no point any time soon are we going to be slipping into a drought it's been very moist the last couple of months and that's keeping the mosquitoes around but it's also keeping the drought away making a very humid as well and will continue to see those rain chances on wednesday sixty percent chance for rain rain chances will drop a little thursday and friday but it looks like there's a cold front coming our way and it's not normal in july that you get a cold front to make it all the way through the state of south carolina and push off the coast but this one may just do it will have to watch it on saturday brings us high chances for rain clears the coast will clear out nicely on sunday and these chances for rain can drop even more. that's why we're going to monitor it and it will get a little less humid but she never liked see a stalled frontal boundary this time of the yearitng out over the atlantic ocean because you can get some and spin up of a possible tropical system not saying that's going to happen but something i keep in the back of my mind with those front if they do make an off the coast. here's what we have right now on live doppler

there. one thunderstorm in the upstate has a severe thunderstorm warning for the most part things are very nice and quiet this evening. most of the showers and thunderstorms farther off to our south to notice the lightning strikes fading away. so our rain is fading away tonight but it's going to flare up again tomorrow. we've got a front stalled pretty much right over top of us will stay here on wednesday and that can keep the chances for rain very close to us in to the day tomorrow probably even into the day thursday to until we get a little dryer on friday as far as what we have with our temperatures we've got seventy eight in charleston it's a little cooler in buford and seventy seven where there's been some rain. eighty degrees up in orangeburg seventy seven colombian then the hotspot greeneville eighty seven this evening forecast as lows around seventy six tonight looks like those isolated thunder showers have pretty much faded away into the day tomorrow we're going to be looking at highs up around eighty eight are not as hot as today because i think will get clouds in quicker and will see those chances for showers and thunderstorms a little higher tomorrow you'll see here on future cast are stalled frontal boundary eleven o'clock this evening as we wind forward in time that fronts eggs a little farther to the south at eight o'clock in morning we still got that little swirl in the atmosphere off to our south that's going to help aid in the formation of some afternoon showers and thunderstorms moving from wednesday into thursday the front still hanging out nearby. so we'll keep that chance for rain in the forecast as far as the cold front there is that's the one that's going to try to get in here on saturday and then push off the coa on sunday and if it does so we will get a little less humid which will be a nice relief for the second half of the weekend it's going to stay very humid the next few days as the rain chances are higher temperatures are

>> bob: green was arrested for hitting edmundson that night but reached a deal. he looks forward to clearing up the misinformation put forth today he said. >> stacia: there's a big political shift to happen in this country. millenials are set to surpass baby boomersext year as the largest generation of americans eligible to vote. that's according to the center for american progress. baby boomers

hey you mentioned the forecast let's get right to it. it does look fantastic for the opening day. we got a lot of sunshine forecast in our area. you can see there at least the sky coverwise that we have 64 at 8:00 in the morning. it opens at 9:00. 79 by noon. 86 by the end of the day. even into the evening hours we will be dry. drop down into the 70s. it's going to be a very nice one. 8:51 is when the sun goes down tomorrow. beautiful shot over downtown columbus right now. 70 is the temperature. humidity not bad. dew point is at 62. for the record today we didn't get out of the 70s. 78 was the actual high temperature. record 104 set back in 1934. but this morning you probably noticed it if you went outside. we dropped to 58. currently we are at 70 in columbus. you get outside of the city center and you have widespread 60s but man didn't it have that crispness to the air? you walked out almost felt almost felt like a fall day. the only reason is because it's been so sticky lately that just that dry crisp air this morning man it just gave you a little taste of what's to come. i see us staying that way. futurecast just has a passing cloud or two and notice by tomorrow morning on the couple of last frames there a few frames you get some of these darker shades of grey. that is the patchy areas of fog that will develop and they will quickly erode by tomorrow morning and we have a lot of sunshine throughout the area. sunglasses sun screen don't forget to bring those tomorrow or else you are going to be toasted by the time the day's over because i don't expect any problems out there. very few if any clouds throughout the entire day. they will be watching our next weather maker working on in for thursday. storm potential is nonexistent tonight. tomorrow subpoenas nonexistent during the day but this map goes into early thursday morning. notice we bring in that general thunderstorms category for early thursday morning. then during the day thursday that's our next weather system. we are in the marginal risk around the columbus metro. that means an isolated strong storm or two possible. you get from circleville into central pickaway county south and at this point there is a slight risk category posted from the storm prediction center meaning scattered severe storms are possible. 65 at midnight. 63 by 3:00. we will drop down to about 60 for the overnight low. your day tomorrow up to about 86. thursday we are watching with the likelihood of showers and thunderstorms around the area. still really focused on late morning and into the afternoon. but the major change or the at least the biggest change in our forecast tonight is keeping that lingered through friday where yesterday it looked like it would all be off to the east tonight models bring in wrap-around moisture. that it's the system moving out slowly some of it spilling back in from the east. so we will keep that chance for lingering showers on friday. but saturday sunday both looking very nice. dry. lot of sunshine. a great weekend to be out at the fair guys. >> stacia: thank you bill. shocking results from a new study on the brains of football players. coming up what it means for the future of the game. >> bob: plus a father in mourning after his teen is killed in a crash. his plea t mom? dad? hi! i had a very minor fender bender tonight in an unreasonably narrow fast food drive thru lane. but what a powerful life lesson. and don't worry i have everything handled. i already spoke to our allstate agent and i know that we have accident forgiveness. which is so smart on your guy's part. like fact that they'll just... forgive you... four weeks without the car. okay. yep. good night. with accident forgiveness your rates won't go up just because of an accident. switching to allstate is worth it. >> bob: new research about football and head injuries with astonishing results. doctors studying the brains of 110 former nfl players. >> as william longgennis reports they found only one didn't have degenerative brain disease. >> reporter: the debilitating brain disease is called c.t.e. symptoms include slurred speech memory loss and dementia. and researchers say it was found in nearly 90% of former football players. from the big leagues to high school. the study involved the brains of 202 deceased players. most donated to a boston brain bank. the biggest sample came from men who once played in the nfl. all but one of the 111 brains examined were diagnosed with c.t.e. among college players 48 of 53 brains were diagnosed with c.t.e. among high school players three of 14 or 21%. in a written statement the nfl said it's quote committed to supporting scientific research and treatment of injuries. doctors say they need advanced diagnostics to test for c.t.e. >> research is going to help us to understand how to diagnose this problem in the living. i am convinced we will be able to diagnose it in the living. we will be able to identify people that are susceptible to later-life problems. >> reporter: the lead author admits bias in the study since all the brains examined came from players who previously showed signs of c.t.e. >> stacia: a fascinating study. looking forward to more information on that. >>> coming up it's the largest project in o-dot history. the new highway that will drive economic growth and get you down south quicker. >>> plus his bosses say he stole from them and then sold the items on ebay. the warning tonight to other businesses abo >> my hope from all of this is that all of the kids realize

"WTTE--07-25-2017-22-28-00.txt",">> my hope from all of this is that all of the kids realize tomorrow's not a given. >> stacia: tonight a family is mourning the death of their daughter after a deadly crash. alexa howard just graduated from hilliard davidson. >> bob: she was known to her family as ali. lisa rantala has her father's heart breaking message for all teenaged drivers. >> lisa: troopers say they were eastbound on lucas road when they ran that stop sign. troopers said they got hit in the intersection. tracks showed them going off road and crashing into trees. on what neighbors call an already troubled road in mcdonald'sin madisoncounty ali tweet texted her dad this picture of prairie oaks metro park. >> i am glad to know my daughter was enjoying the beauty of the world. >> lisa: the picture came with the message she's on her way home. >> it's an unfathomable ending to what was a beautiful day. >> lisa: but within an hour troopers told jamie howard that his main care-giver his daughter was dead. jamie is paralyzed from the waist down after his near-fatal crash when ali was just 15. >> it's unimaginable that one incident like this could happen to any family. it's that much more tragic that we have had two. >> lisa: and because of what they have endured over the years jamie also finds certain evidence here unimaginable. troopers told him ali wasn't wearing her seat belt. they say her 17-year-old friend driving ran a stop sign and got hit by another car. >> my hope from all of this is that all of the kids realize tomorrow's not a given. >> lisa: so through grief jamie sends a message to other parents and their teen aged drivers. >> when your mom and your dad tell you to be careful or call you on the phone or text you to be careful -- or remind you to put on your seat belt -- they are doing it out of love. >> lisa: as to finding beauty after ali's death if jamie's words save a life -- and his next door neighbors cutting out their own paths of support where ali left off. >> he was out mowing the lawn because that's something my daughter ali did. and he's aware and knows that she can't. >> bob: at last check ali's friend sarah the driver of the car was still in the hospital in serious condition. troopers are trying to figure out why she ran the stop sign and they say that investigation could take several days. >> stacia: ali howard is the third teen killed in a car crash in central ohio within the last two weeks. ohio lawmakers hope to cut down on fatal teen crashes by increasing the amount of time new drivers would have to hold permits. the bill would require drivers under the age of 18 to hold a permit for one year instead of six months. they would be banned from driving between 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. unless companied by a parent. this bill has not been assigned to a house committee yet. >> bob: the u.s. is a step closer to imposing new sanctions against russia. the house of representatives overwelmingly passed a sanctions bill today. the plan also includes new sanctions against iran and north korea and gives congress the power to block any effort by the white house to weaken sanctions on russia. the senate still needs to approve the plan and the president hasn't indicated whether he would sign the bill. >> stacia: right now hilliard police are on the lookout for a man they say stole from his former bus and sold the stuff on ebay. they say robert hamlin worked for classic cycle parts. police say he used his work computer to sell more than $10000 of rare auto parts that didn't belong to him. the owner says he also claimed to be a veteran but he never served in the military. >> i don't like to hear that when somebody uses the military to try to gain an advantage at a job. want him off the streets to stop harming other businesses. >> stacia: police say they believe he may have pulled the same scheme while working at other businesses in the area. they want anyone who may have hired him to check their inventory and call hilliard police if anything is missing. >> bob: the ohio medical marijuana control program has approved a plan to create a seed-to-sale tracking system. here's what that means. the program will track medical marijuana plants from cultivation through sale. regulators say it will be paid for as part of $6 million in funding that was approved today. >>> new developments now after a security guard is attacked and raped. 18-year-old neimiah hunter has been indicted on multiple charges including rape sexual battery assault and rape. according to police the victim was on foot patrol when she was attacked. a dna profile came back with a match to hunter. his arraignment is set for fry friday. >> stacia: o-dot is halfway through its largest project ever. the portsmouth by-pass will connect sciotoville to lucasville and help you get to the ohio river faster. the 16-mile highway looks close to completion on the north end where concrete barriers are poured on-site. according to odot the southern ohio veterans memorial highway is not about passing the city of portsmouth but rather bringing business. >> across the way over there we have a 100000 square foot metal fabrication facility. up the hill we have american electric power and then -- >> stacia: the project is planned to be finished by december of 2018. >> bob: we are looking forward to featuring some big buckeye matchups right here on fox 28 during the season. coming up what announcers are looking forward to most about calling the game. >> stacia: and meet the new engineer for ford who is really making waves with her ideas at just 23 years old. why she says she sees things differently. >> bill: and good evening everyone. what a beautiful night it is outside. we are a little warmer in downtown columbus where the temperature is still hanging out at 70 but you get outside of the city get away from the concrete we have widespread mid 60s. a little bit of patchy fog. otherwise it's a very nice day. the opening day of the ohio state fair. tazhayakov your buckeye football viewing get -- >> stacia: your buckeye football viewing gets a new viewing. you should keep remote handy. >> bob: they will be on abc6 and right here on fox 28 too. clay hall has more from chicago with the announcers who will be bringing us the game. >> clay: a good good evening to you. welcome back to chicago where the big 10 meetings are concluding here today. a new era dawning in big 10 football. further influenced by fox sports who has televised the conference title game from the outset. but now they have secured ""the game"" for the first time ever. in a passionate gus johnson will be on the call. >> i still can't really believe it to be totally honest with you. it's the biggest game in our country. ollege. it it's the greatest rivalry in the history of our country. period. >> to know that we are going to get to call gus and i the michigan/ohio state game in what i believe is one of those pockets of -- its greatest importance and so it's going to be amazing. >> clay: dublin coffman and notreandnotre dame grad brady quinn will be in the booth week three at the shoe for ohio state and army. >> i don't think i have been in the press box since i was recruited by ohio state. i can't wait to see thousand's changed how the team is starting to develop a couple of weeks into the season. >> there's so much history in the big 10 for me and all of these different stadiums that i've dreamed of going to. it's going to be really special. >> bob: oh yeah. starting to get geeked up for this. buckeyes training camp starts early thursday morning. first game of the year august 31 against indiana or at least of the season. the regular season wraps up on november 25 in ann arbor of course. expectations always running high for some games after that. >> stacia: coming up the last killer whale born in captivity passes away at sea world. what we know tonight about what caused her death. >> bob: plus can michael jackson's

[laughter] makes me feel happy. >> bob: fascinating. >> stacia: very impressive. well done. >> bob: and doesn't drive. >> stacia: that's right. that's the key there. that's really really extra fascinating. ok. so for those worried they would lose access to microsoft paint after today -- have no fear. microsoft says it will be offering the program for free in their windows store. the company decided to keep ms paint after an incredible outpouring of support and nostalgia. a different app called paint 3d will also be included in current and future versions of windows. >> bob: something that makes us go hmmmm today we all know good music makes life better. can it make your drinks taste better? one distillery hopes so. they pump music right into the barrels of their whiskey. it spends three years in the barrel room with the sounds of michael jackson or led zeppelin going straight into the barrel on repeat. >> listening to the same play list for three years in a row you are either going to go crazy or become like a genius. right? so let's hope for a little bit of both. >> how can we get the interaction between the liquid and the wood behave in a different way? we thought we could excite that by using sound vibration. >> bob: that's interesting. they say every time they produce a batch of whiskey they make two barelies. one with music one without. after three years they put them to the test and the musical barrel always wins. >> stacia: this is fascinating. fascinating. i get the idea of the sound vibrations changing things up. but how loud is the music? >> bob: and you have some heavy beat in there some hip hop or whatever and you would think that would have a real effect. >> bill: could be. when they put the one with michael jackson up against one that doesn't have it one might say that that whiskey -- beat it -- [booing] >> stacia: how long did it take you to think that one up? >> bob: he hasn't said a word since 10:00 night. he'sbeen back there going. >> stacia: scribbling jokes. beat it. beat it. >> bill: good night folks it. thank you. >> bob: the work is done. >> bill: i'm here to provide a thriller. let's just stop it right now. you pretty young thing. ok. leave it alone. >> bob: just look at the man in the mirror and be ashamed. >> bill: i'm going to do this weather off the wall. let's justin. here we go. easterly winds at six miles per hour. humidity levels very low at 76%. the dew point is 62. so you feel a little bit of humidity out there on our muggy meter that falls into that range here. but as we go through the night tonight we will be playing with the comfortable low humidity level. that's about it. same thing with tomorrow. so that's nice. we will jump back up to muggy if not a little soupy on thursday. by friday we will watch as the temperatures kind of come down a little or the temperatures hang around but the muggy meter stays in that muggy area. 67 for upper arlington. a very nice night. 67 in powell. plain city right around 68. a beautiful evening. again just a touch sticky. so s maybe a windows closed night even though temperatures are very nice. 711 in cleveland. up to the north 63 for the upper peninsula. 73 for lexington. so high pressure remains our dominant weather feature. tracking rain showers off to the west. that's what will be working in here by thursday. that's our next weather system. in terms of tomorrow many of you going to the fair for opening day. clear skies tonight. patchy areas of fog early tomorrow morning. otherwise the high pressure cell stays in place. beautiful day. temperatures will be warmer than they were today. we got to 78 officially. tomorrow probably in the 85 86 range. somewhere in there with just a little more humidity than today. but i mean -- lots of sunshine. have your sun screen and sunglasses with you if you are out and about tomorrow. all day long. you will want that. then we will watch another weather system start to bring us some increasing clouds late tomorrow night and into thursday and that one look like we'll have overcast skies for the most part on thursday with off and on rain throughout the day. mainly late morning and into the afternoon early evening. it doesn't look as likely for the early morning hours but we will be tracking that tomorrow. 65 at midnight. 63 by 3:00. we will go down to about 60 at 6:00 in the morning up to 64 at 8:00. heading out tomorrow? midday right around 79. 5:00 the peak temperature is 86. by the time that sun gees down closer to the 9:00 hour we are back down into to the 70s. if you are making your way out to the fair tomorrow. and temperatures 85 the normal high. notice that they are either at or below slightly when you look through the seven-day forecast and the weekend saturday sunday still looking delightful and you can of course always track weather. if you down led our ohio weather app. it it's available to download in the app store or google play. just search ohio wx. guys? oh it's you. stewart... what are you doing? hiding. customers at my bank are real mad because we keep hitting them with overdraft fees. at huntington we invented 24-hour grace. we give them until the next day to fix their overdraft and avoid the fee. how's that working for you? i don't have to wear a disguise so... pretty well i guess. oh. hey there's another banker protecting his identity. hey which bank do you work at? we aren't those other banks. we have 24-hour grace. huntington. welcome. >> congressional democrats announced an economic agenda lowering health care costs and limiting corporate m >> boris epstein a former trump campaign senior adviser and white house official provides his commentary on the new agenda and possibility for bipartisan support. >> problems. we all have them. the first step to dealing with the problem is admitting it exists. it seems that the democrats are taking that first step. >> when you lose an election with someone who has say 40% popularity you look in the mirror and say what did we do wrong? the number one thing that we did wrong is we didn't tell people what we stood for. >> the democrats do appear to be learning from their losses in the 2016 presidential election. they understand that they have largely fallen out of touch with american people. a recent abc news washington post poll found that only 37% of americans think the democrat party stands for something. 52% says it just stands against president trump. what is the democratic party to do? apparently it is to have a mix of 10 senators and representatives drive 65 miles west of washington dc and announce a new plan. a better deal. better jobs. better wages. better future. yes. the slogan may remind you of a popular pizza chain that rhymes with papa don's. >> going past the slogan there are some great policy proposals presented by the democrats. creating 10 mill jobs through apprenticeship programs and tech incentives. lowering prescription prices. setting new standards for corporate mergers. the trump administration is already working on some. last month president trump signed an executive order to substantially increase the number of apprenticeships in the united states. the administration is also working on plans to address the high cost of prescription drugs. slogans are great. but democrats now need to connect with american people by action not words. movement on agenda items where the democrats actually agree with the white house would be a good start. some parts of the democra better deal line up with the policies of the white house so we could actually hope for concrete bipartisan achievements not gridlock. and that's the bottom line. >> stacia: ok you guys. we missed a major milestone yesterday. our favorite baby hippo turned six months old. and we didn't even stop to celebrate. >> bill: well that's awful. >> stacia: i know. we're horrible people. but luckily we have another milestone to mark with her today. fiona tipped the scales at 404 pounds. she still has a lot of growing to do. her mom bb weighs around 3000 pounds. so she is a growing girl. she's on her way. >> bob: fiona 400 and fabulous. >> stacia: i can't believe we missed her six-month birthday yesterday. >> bob: by the way at the expense of the seventh day we were talking michael jackson songs and this entire crew including these two have never heard of michael jackson's greatest song. >> stacia: the greatest song? >> bill: the greatest song. >> bob: you don't have a friend like ben. that's -- >> bill: he says to me he says i should have tossed over go down the weather ben. she and i said what relevance is that? why didn't you just say billy jean? doesn't that make a little more sense? oh i could have said that too. >> stacia: it was all so bad. [laughter] >> bill: very nice. see you later. >> stacia: turn that off.

thursday starting great but ending stormy. maybe some really storms in the morning. we will have to see the timing. early friday left over but much of friday looks really good. cooler and although still kind of warm this upcoming weekend still drive. humidity low. it will feel good out there. it won't be too hot. next week we will slowly introduce more august like weather august. there is marty the snyder. he will have weather information tomorrow like he does most mornings. >> we will take the chamber of commerce forecast. >> warren called me up and said let's go we've got to make it happen. >> thank the mayor for that one. >>> we have our fox feedback at 10:00. groceries from wegmans delivered right to your door with the convenience of a new shopping up. so logical of course for us to ask tonight how often you might avail yourself of that service. of the 755 who responded to our twitter poll only 8% said all the time. 11% said frequently. 35% said once in a while. that's what i said. i've got to try it. but 46% said never. they like to go to wegmans. they like to shop. they like to block the aisles. fight the crowds look for a parking spot. >> i liked one woman's response. she said finally if i make the list i will stick to it. it's all the other stuff you pick up on the way. >> although i will be looking around going i'll pick up a couple of those. >> let me know how it goes. >>> when we come back on fox rochester how girl scouts will i have no family history of breast cancer and i'm busy. clinics aren't open when i'm free. it's hard to find time. new york state leads the nation making it easy to get breast cancer screenings. hospitals and clinics across the state will offer screenings --- mornings evenings - even weekends. and early detection saves lives. now there are no excuses. and no time to waste. get screened. no excuses. for more information -- go to n y dot gov slash get screened >>> justin the senate has voted to block a wide-ranging proposal by republicans to repeal much of former president barack obama's health care law and replace it with a more restricted plan. senators voted 57 243 to reject -- 57 to 43 to reject that plan. that vote included nine republicans underscoring problems republicans will have in winning enough votes to be cast obamacare. >>> girl scouts will soon be able to pursue 23 new badges related to s.t.e.m. careers and the outdoors. they can earn badges for things like designing model racecars writing code programming building robots and environmentally conscious camping trips.>>> and now our good day bad day. >> a bad day for a suspected drunk driver. he crossed paths with the wrong guy. alejandro hernandez had the driver trapped and went in for a citizens arrest. >> stop it. stop right now. stop. >> one of my best friends died because of a drunk driver so i was thinking about that. >> reporter: and a good day for baby bo who stole the show at the wiener dog nationals. a near record time of almost 7 seconds made baby bo the fastest wiener in the west. that's a hot dog. >> 7 seconds is the record. >> baby bo was pretty close. >> we did not have that in sports. >>> we >>> now 13 wham  sports driven by bob johnson chevrolet. >> many bills fans had to be excited one veteran receiver and john bolton  visited the team yesterday. there has been no contract deal and there is a good chance he is still seeing what else is out there but he would be a very positive veteran addition if he signed on. wide receiver isn't the only position we need. they needed depth and they added some today. bacarri rambo returns to buffalo. bills fans will remember this game from 2014. he picked off star quarterback aaron rodgers twice in the upset at orchard park. rambo played 19 games and had free pics. but more on the defense. let's bring in toby motyka. >> toby is here. let's focus on this defense. let's start with each different position group. let's talk about the defensive line to begin with. >> upfront this is the unit that should carry this defense. if it has a good season the defensive line will have a good season. jerry hughes marcell dareus jack lawson big names but i worry about every single one of these guys. jerry hughes has had 11 sacks combined the last two years. marcell dareus who knows if he wants to play. kyle lewis at some point will play his age and jack lawson has half a season behind his belt. who is behind these guys if anything goes wrong? what happens with adolphus washington? this is the unit that should push this defense forward but anything can happen. >> it's definitely a top end of the defense because that is where the big names are. depth is a problem. linebacker. >> that's a problem everywhere. >> it is. >> who are the starters going to be? you assume reggie ragland. you hope he can play like they expected him to last year which would bump preston brown a.b. into a backup role but then lorenzo alexander an assumed starter has had one good year. it was a great year under rex ryan. you wonder how that will affect him. the other outside spot you have to look at a piece of paper. is it going to be milano romano or the guy they just signed hodgins? linebacker is a huge question. and a really important part i might add to the mcdermott defense. they need a guy like ragland to shine right away for the group to be successful. >> and then we go to the secondary which was bad last year. but stephon gilmore is taking his money and his primetime tv slot and he has gone to new england. but it could be at least three maybe four and if you count the slot could be five new starters. >> it could and stay what you want about stephon gilmore he didn't play his best last year. he is still pretty good. they are going to miss him. white the rookie has looked good. assume a starter. but you never know. darby holy regression batman. hopefully he can bounce back. two safeties and then nicole coleman drawn. that's if seymour doesn't beat up darby. they were bad last year so how much worse can it get? you lost your best player so until proven otherwise this group is one giant question mark and has a lot to prove heading into camp. >> speaking of heading into camp here is the schedule as it looks. they start out thursday. that is the one evening session here in pittsford and then friday afternoon a couple of practices in the morning on the weekend and then they are off on monday. >>> did you hear about lucky whitehead? the team cut him yesterday. the latest was an arrest for shoplifting. but one problem he said it was mistaken identity. someone claimed to be him. the police confirmed but the cowboys didn't change his mind. so i guess jerry jones told his coach exactly what he had to say. >> yesterday we made a decision that we deemed to be in the best interests of the dallas cowboys. we are standing by that decision and we're going to move forward. it's the truth. we made a decision without was in the best interest of the dallas cowboys. we are going to stand by that decision and move forward. this is the last time i'll say it. i appreciate your interest. we made a decision yesterday in regards to lucky whitehead that we believe is the right decision -- that we believe is the right decision and we are standing by it. >>> the sabres have their starting goalie for the upcoming season robert leonard. he agreed to $4 million for one >>> after a great homestand the wings started their homestand with game number two. the red wings were down for 2- zero ditch. take one out to left center field for the home run to make it 4-1. but once again equipment be the wings night in indy. just a slow roller. it's going to stay fair. bring in the run. the wings lose again her second in a row. >>> joe girardi and the yankees against the wings. he's going to take this one to right center. it's going to go to the wall. tyler wade would come home to score. the yankees win final 4-2. >>> last month we told the story of lansinburgh one of the top long drivers in golf -- stephen waynesburg one of the top long drivers in golf. he was in mile high colorado tonight. he lots of sun apply. 460 yards he had one earlier. this one pretty close. but unfortunately for ryan in the semifinals his competitor hit one 490 yards. >> what are they using? >> that's like a par 5. >> 490 yards. it's like a rocket. >> i thought i was a stud hitting 250. >> you weren't. you weren't it all -- at all. >> he said that out loud. >> i tell the truth. let's take a look at our late forecast. >>> we do have a good-looking day tomorrow. a break for the folks on the lake tomorrow. >>> we will see you again on channel 13 at 11:00. >>> problems. we all have them. the first step to dealing with the problem is admitting it exists. it seems that the democrats are taking that first step. >> when you lose an election with someone who has say 40% popularity you look in the mirror and say what did we do wrong? the number one thing we did wrong is we didn't tell people what we stood for. >> democrats do appear to be running from their loss in the 2016 presidential election. they understand they have largely fallen out of touch with the american people. a recent washington post poll found only 40% of people think the democratic party stands for something. 52% say it just stands against president trump. apparently the party is to have senators drive 60 miles west of washington dc and announce a new plan a better deal better jobs better wages better future. yes the slogan may remind you of a popular pizza chain. >> better ingredients better pizza papa john's. >> going past the slogan proposals made by the democrats to create 10 million jobs through tax incentives apprenticeships tax programs penalties for corporate mergers. the trump administration is already working on some of these. last month president donald trump signed an executive order to substantially increase the number of apprenticeships in the yes. the administration is also working on plans to address the high cost of prescription drugs. slogans are great but democrats need to connect with the american people with actions not words. movement on agenda items where times actually agree with the white house would be a good start. some parts of the democrats line up with the getting screened for breast cancer just costs too much. co-pays are high - and insurance has deductables. the cost is always an issue. new york state leads the nation making breast cancer screenings cost-free --- no co-pays deductables or other costs. screenings are free for nearly all women --- even if you have no insurance. and early detection saves lives. now there are no excuses. and no cost to me. get screened. no excuses. go to n y dot gov slash get screened

[squawks] - not a doctor. - shh. ight now on two on your side at 10 on fox... it's been getting a lot of attention on social media... tonight we're getting answers about how often police checkpoints are used in the city of buffalo. plus erie county executive mark poloncarz has been working for years to transform the old bethlehem steel site... we asked him the tough questions about the county's purchase of that land... and if it will really bring businesses here. and-- another study was released linking football to degenerative brain diseases. we'll speak to high school football coaches about the potential impact on younger players.. and ways to reduce the risks. new tonight we are looking into an issue that's getting a lot of attention on social media.... buffalo police traffic checkpoints. there are facebook groups dedicated to alerting drivers about where they are. and now as the democratic primary in the mayoral race approaches it's become an election issue. this is a big topic of debate especially now that people can post about checkpoints and their experiences with them online. so we want to know how often do you think police checkpoints should be used? more often less often or the same. you can vote right now at wgrz-dot- com slash vote. we will show you the results live at the bottom of your screen as my story airs. tonight i spoke with a buffalo woman who is upset after her daughter was stopped at a checkpoint... and i got some answers from police. katrinna martin- bordeaux says her daughter was stopped at a buffalo police traffic checkpoint monday just after 5 p-m on leslie street on buffalo's east side. martin-bordeaux rushed to the checkpoint and went live on facebook. her video has been shared by almost two-hundred people... and has more than 10- thousand views. ""this is something that is constantly happening in our community in our neighborhood and it's not an isolated incident this isn't our first rodeo and this isn't her first time ever being stopped. i've just had it at this point."" martin-bordeaux says her daughter was pulled over for an alleged seat belt infraction but was wearing her seat belt and ultimately did not receive a ticket. tuesday night martin-bordeaux led a meeting of the young black democrats of western new york.. to rally voters and quote ""change the culture of the buffalo police department."" we were not permitted to shoot video of the meeting but we spoke with martin- bordeaux before it began. kelly: ""do you think if police are saying well we're doing this because we think it will help make our community safer will get bad people off the roads and this is a safety issue what would you say to that?"" katrinna: ""what i would say to that is that we need to move to do a foia request i would like to see a fioa request to see how many of these police checkpoints are set up in high impact communities opposed to other communities so we can actually see the statistical breakdown of felonious crimes that they're catching people doing with these checkpoints."" and that is information we do not have. buffalo mayor byron brown was not made available for an interview tuesday but i spoke with buffalo police lt. jeff rinaldo on the phone who told me the checkpoints are done in an effort to make the roads safer by making sure drivers have a license registration and insurance. rinaldo told me many factors contribute to the location of checkpoints - including calls from concerned citizens and data about where traffic accidents happen and where speeding is a problem. he also said the locations are chosen based on where it's safe for police to pull people over. we requested specific information from police and they gave us the locations for july first through the 7-th. the checkpoints were held across the city... spread out across different neighborhoods... three each day except for july 4-th when there weren't any. now this is only a snapshot of information. lt. rinaldo told me the number this year is probably similar to last year but we don't have exact numbers. and we don't know whether the number of locations has increased or decreased. we also don't know how many people were stopped what they were stopped for or whether they were cited or arrested. the buffalo police department requested that we do not make these locations public because they are concerned about the safety of the officers... and we are respecting that. you can still vote in our poll at wgrz-dot-com slash vote. we will stay on this story.... and ask the mayor about it the next time we see him. we're asking the tough questions tonight.. after erie county bought nearly 150 acres of the old bethlehem steel site in lackawanna. county executive mark poloncarz is hoping to attract developers.... and eventually transform the long-abandoned site.... into a high tech industrial park. but will it really pay off? poloncarz says the 5-point-5 million dollar investment is well worth it-- because of its location and he says it will increase the tax base and create jobs. the county also says it will invest even more money to build the necesssary infrastructure to set up the land for private companies to move in. ""you said you guarantee that there will be companies and jobs here. how can you guarantee that? i guarantee it david. i guarantee it. because i know of the communications we've already had with members of the private sector... uh... it will happen."" poloncarz didn't give specifics about the types of businesses he says are interested in the site. it's being built in partnership with u- b with space to be leased to small companies. the g-o-p health care bill has passed a motion... to start a debate in the senate to repeal obamacare. this came after senator john mccain made a dramatic return to washington today after getting a blot clot removed from his head and learning of a brain cancer diagnosis. mccain proved to be a decisive vote for his party.. and the senate to move forward... to even begin discussing health care. the final vote ended up being a 50/50 split - with vice president pence breaking the tie in republican's favor. an astonishing health study just released from the american medical association discovered a link between football and a degenerative brain disease called c-t-e. c-t-e-- or chronic traumatic encephalopathy -- is thought to be caused by repeated blows to the head. the study looked at the brains of 111 n- f-l players... and found 110 of their brains had signs of the disease. that study also included a limited number of high school football players... three of the 14 players at that level had c-t-e. two on your side's ron plants spoke tonight with a successful high school coach.. and section 6 official... for their take on the potential impact on younger players... and ways to reduce the risk he won a state football championship in 2015 with the south park high sparks...and coach tim delaney is looking forward to another season but with this mindset for his young players... ""delaney: take your head and your helmet out of play as far as blocking and tackling."" the philosophy of the heads up safety program which as we've shown you has been taught in numerous clinics for coaches and league officials...using the shoulder instead for the tackle. along with other safety policies on and off the field... ""stoldt: we're doing a lot less contact during the week than we've ever done in the past. and i think that helps reduce our injury rates. coaches and parents undertsand the signs and symptoms of concussion i think now better than they ever have. the state has a return to play protocol put in place so that kids aren't coming back too soon."" some of that learned from tragic even fatal injuries at the high school level...however... ""reporter: it is a contact sport to begin with...so while you're looking for ways to make it safer...there may be limitations there? delaney: yeah... people die in car accidents and everybody still drives. it's the same thought...you don't have to play football...it is a tough physical game and we just try to make it as safe as possible for the kids that are getting invoklved."" coach delaney also points out the duration of a playing career size of the players and speed of the game at the high school versus college or especially pro level...but is all the cte concern having it;s own impact... ""stoldt: five years ago when i started with usa football we saws a lot of parents who were under the feeling that i'm not gonna let my child play and now i think ...more and more are becoming educated as to the things that we're doing to try and prevent some of these issues."" coach delaney says popular flag and touch football leagues for younger players may draw more participants....but always with the goal of 11 on 11 ""tackle"" football though with safer equipment like upgraded helmets and again that heads up tackling emphasis... ron plants - channel 2 news... a new program is taking off in the capitol region that the erie county district attorney wants to bring to erie county... coming up we'll explain how the ""lead"" program can help in the opioid crisis. but first kevin is here with a preview of our forecast. kevin? e latest numbers from the erie county health department show the opioid epidemic could claim the lives of nearly four-hundred people by the end of the year. last year there were three-hundred deadly overdoses. earlier tonight on channel 2 news at 6 we told you that the erie county district attorney's office is now looking to a program in albany to help solve this crisis. the program is called lead -- or law enforcement assisted diversion. albany is the first city in the state to use this program which is voluntary among police officers. the goal is to get people with additions into treatment and those who are homeless and dealing with mental issues... the help they need. ""it's really easy to get discouraged working patrol and seeing these people you arrest just cycle in and out of the court system and it's almost like to what end? when are you gonna stop what you're doing and try something different?"" when officers who have opted into the program respond to a scene and encounter a suspect of a low- level crime who's addicted to drugs or homeless or has mental health issues... albany police can call a hotline 24/7... which connects them to a caseworker from catholic charities. last month d-a john flynn sent a team of prosecutors to albany to learn about the program. tonight at 11... in the second part of our two on your side ""original"" investigation... jeff preval will ask the tough questions to d-a flynn ... about how the program could work here in erie county.. and how he's going to try to get police here to buy into the program. kevin's got your full forecast coming up next. you're watching 2 on your side at 10... on fox. day forecast in today's i could be any exception the one thing you will notice is that the temperatures in court a need several more days before we can finally cracked that 80 mark on the next five looks like we got rain showers definitely coming our way on thursday a few leftovers on friday but the early call for the upcoming weekend is looking pretty good winds coming out of the north keeping those temperatures definitely in the upper 60s to about 70 there's plenty of very warm air off to our west but again the flow of the air around our region right now is coming out of the north and that's one of the reasons that work of cooler than normal big picture is showing that we do have some are rain showers as far as western new york is concerned nothing happening around our immediate area right now but things off to the west will start to percolate a little bit it's interesting we've been talking about how warm we haven't been well 90 that seems to be the mark in an average year we only see 40s in the 90s haven't had any so far this year between 86 and 90 we usually get 16 we've only had for but 80 and up to the 86 mark 54 days per year and so far we've had 21. you can see out to the west coming through parts of the dakotas in minnesota a little line a little frontal line rate there probably won't be affecting us at all until possibly thursday but the next 12  tose temperatures are good to be almost fall like cattaraugus county fair look and sunny and upper 60s tomorrow and right next door in chautauqua likewise the good be looking at 68 i was some sunny skies down there 79 could be the high tomorrow with very light northerly wins will see the wind shifted the south and temperatures up to 70 more humidity and some rain showers are coming our way on thursday going to future luck. i think the morning commute tomorrow will feature some scattered clouds to the south and the north they will be scoured out during the afternoon as we get our way into wednesday night. that's when the clouds are really do start to second during the overnight we could see a few showers off to the northern areas niagara orleans maybe northern genesee county by the commute time on thursday and thursday afternoon right there were to start seeing again that frontal line crossing the region around midafternoon and they could be packing some showers and maybe even some embedded thundershowers coming our way tomorrow will be in the upper 70s and we have a repeat performance but also some rain showers coming our way on thursday and the seven-day forecast says that the weekend is looking great in the 80s return monday and tuesday of next week also some rain showers coming our way on thursday and the seven-day forecast says that the weekend is looking great in the 80s return monday and tuesday of next week y. the rochester- based store is expanding the service here in the queen city rochester and syracuse next month. here's how it works... you place your order online... or through the ""insta-cart"" app... and groceries will be delivered in about an hour. there ""is"" a 6-dollar fee for delivery. and there are some restrictions... on things like alcohol. and we're celebrating western new york with a unique rescue operation. an erie county sheriff's deputy responded to the call of an owl tangled in a soccer goal net at veteran's park in grand island. luckily deputy angela kopacz was able to get the owl free... and it flew away relatively unscathed. stick around jonah javad is back in next for sports. you're watching 2 on your side at 10 on fox. is. for the bills the that's just the way it is. for the bills the offseason has been full of it. new gm. new head coach. new way of doing things. but it's up to the players on the field to make this season unlike the last 17. our countdown to camp continues tonight and we lead off with the best player on the team. after a down year in 2015 mccoy was a superstar last season. 15 games nearly 1300 yards and 14 total touchdowns. and he averaged a career-best 5.4 yards per carry. running backs are supposed to decline with age but lesean mccoy is like a botfrom spiel the wine. top shelf. with mike gillislee gone mccoy is in line for more touches more yards and more touchdowns. and you'll hear no complains from 25. losing mike gillislee is tough. he had 9 touchdowns last year and averaged 5.7 yards per carry. absurd numbers from a backup but it's a testament to the bills offensive line. === replacing gillisee will likely be jonathan williams. the second year man played sparingly in his rookie season. scoring once and fumbling twice. he's got big shoes to fill and he has no excuses running behind that line. especially if fullback mike tolbert is out there too. the bills signed two prominent fullbacks in tolbert and patrick dimarco. tolbert is a 250 pound bowling ball and will help out on the goal line. dimarco will be an asset to the passing game whether it's as a blocker or coming out of the backfield to catch the ball - something he excelled at in atlanta. speaking of the passing game... tight end charles clay is the glue to the offense. when mccoy or sammy watkins are covered clay is usually wide open 20 yards down field. he felt like a figment of our imagination last year until he scored all four of his touchdowns in the final four weeks of the season. if tyrod taylor can get him involved it opens up the offense for everyone. meanwhile the bills signed three free agents today. the most notable - bacarri rambo. the bills safety turned in two memorable games during his 19 game stint in buffalo. two interceptions in a win over the packers in 2014. and the game- sealing interception against the jets in 2015. rambo adds depth and experience to a thin group of safeties. think about buffalo new york. no really. think about it. are you thinking about snow? are you thinking about rust? if you are we have a surprise for you. meet the unexpected buffalo. you should really see it for yourself. the team has signed #1 goalie robin lehner to a one year 4 million dollar deal and thereby avoiding arbitration. keep in mind lehner was a tim murray acquisition so new gm jason botterill wasn't ready to hitch his wagon with a long-term deal just yet. one year gives the sabres insurance in case lehner doesn't meet expectaions. and it gives lehner millions of reasons to exceed them. his .920 save percentage last year was 10th best in the league despite seeing the third most shots. however he did not make one save in a shootout. something he has to improve next season. at 4 million lehner ranks 25th in annual salary for nhl goalies. thanks for watching two on your side at ten. we'll see you back here tomorrow night. z2g7bz zi0z y2g7by yi0y

enlarged imaging and operates remotely in the tiny pathways of the brain. the doctor developed his own set of flexible catheters and tubes for the tiny hair like pathways that navigate the brain. >>  it allows us to steer and bend the catheters and stiffen the catheter to resist that navigation push as we're going around the curves. >>  the doctor says the real potential in all of this could

getting more details about the >>> we're getting details about the senate vote that erupt in washington today. >> rick:  mike pence had to cast the deciding vote for the senate to move forward with debate on the bill. the vote is basically a major boost to president trump's campaign promise to repeal and replace obamacare. two days ago the gop struggling to get support to bring the bill to a vote. they decided to change up the game a little bit and instead brought a vote to the floor to bring the entire argument to the floor to continue debate which will allow amendments to come forth to tweak the bill before bringing it to the a vote. from the white house and last minute capitol hill dealings approval gained. last week several lawmakers seem to be dead set against moving forward with the bill. republican capito said she would not vote for it as is. portman and paul all agreed it was best to work out this new way to get debate to the floor rather than let things go as they were. now senate majority leader mcconnell will lay out the path for what the gop needs to do next. >>  it'll be on reconciliation for the rest of the week. processing amendments i've offered one and then there will be others. it's an open amendment process. this is just the beginning. we're not out here to spike the football. this is a long way but we'll finish at the end of the week. hopefully with a measure that can either go to the house and taken up or go to conference. we're pleased to have been able to take the first step in that direction today. >> kallie:  the senate can build a new bill by using a foundation of amendments meaning any new legislation will not look like any of the bills that have been presented so far but democrats like west virginias manchin are weary of republicans looking to rush the bill through after today's vote. >>  can't bring the expert witnesses in. you can't look at the facts. you can't make your decision. you can't have your debates. you can have limited debates based on whose controlling what you're talk about. that's what we're in and why i'm opposed to it. >> kallie:  it's important to remember today's vote only allows the senate to debate the bill on the senate floor. this won't happen in committees. it is not a final approval but it is an important step in the president's plan to end obamacare. >>>more than a dozen people protested in front of senator capito's charleston office today. protestors organized by the west virginia citizen action group said they want capito to keep her word to not throw west virginians off the cliff. capito did vote today for the senate to go forward and debate legislation to repeal and replace the affordable care act. >>  we think senator capito needs to know that not only are the people in this state outraged at the possibility of losing healthcare. people in this state are willing to support her if she should take the stand of standing up to her party. >> kallie:  the future of the u.s. attorney general sessions in jeopardy tonight. >> rick:  sessions recueing himself from that russia investigation and since he's drawn the ire of the president. trump expressing his feelings at a

have quite simply picked somebody else. >> rick:  sessions back then was the first senator publicly to support the trump campaign and the first person tmp picked for his cabinet. in march when

permanent place to stay. since the states first sanctioned drag races track opened in 1958. organizers say it makes sense the hall of fame's permanent home be in winfield. now organizers are on a mission to collect racing relics and pictures to preserve the history of the sport that's been a big part of the region for many years. >>  we have the chemical plants. we had the power plants. we had

out families that have to prioritize every cent. this was happening just in time for back to school. it's been going on 20 years now in johnson county. the turnout gets better every year. >>  so many students that could go to school without that new backpack or without their own box of crayons. we just want to make sure that they feel like they belong just as much as any other child. >> rick:  first day of school in johnson county is august 3rd. >> brandon: we saw a gorgeous day today on tuesday. made it up to 83 in charleston. 81 in huntington and also low humidity. most importantly it was quiet with sunshine. susan tells us it was comfortable in st. albans. as of 6:0081 no rainfall and . thank you susan. right now in charleston 68. comfortable stuff. look at spencer already into the upper 50s. it feels like football weather. that number might be a little high in summersville. 64 beckley. you get the picture already comfortable. tomorrow we're in the upper 50s and with some of that cool air. any time you get air to cool off to the maximum potential that usually means areas of fog will develop especially near the river valleys. otherwise toasty warm at lunchtime. 80 and that's something you'll notice tomorrow. it's going to turn hotter. 85 at 3:00. 89 at 6:00. some cumulous clouds bellow up and one or two down in the southern counties kick off a shower. huntington and charleston dry. we are watching the potential for severe thunderstorms here. thursday low pressure generally looks to track from illinois back towards ohio. exact timing in question but the raw ingredients appear to be there to sustain some severe thunderstorms. a warm humid unstable air mass. winds at the surface coming in out of the south. jet stream winds more out of the west. the crisscross motion and willingness for the air to rise up within that may allow for severe thunderstorms. especially late thursday. that's a time frame we're eyeing right now. no such worries tonight in towards wednesday. looks terrific. patchy fog perhaps near the river value lease. lunchtime tomorrow cumulous clouds south and east of town. there's the shower and thunderstorm chance small tomorrow. the due south wind rising up the mountain slopes. any time it rises it moistens. the mountains may manufacture a shower or thunderstorm in south eastern counties. raleigh fayette greenbrier. that process doesn't work for kanawha county. we don't have to worry about that. thursday afternoon mostly dry but again thursday evening is the time frame we're looking at for the potential for strong to severe thunderstorms. tomorrow it's hot. we watch thursday into friday morning. we dry out friday evening. weekend fantastic very comfortable. first day of august on tuesday looks hot. >>>from from the terrorism alert desk in washington i'm lindsy mastis. president trump has refused to sign off on a plan to send more troops to afghanistan. trump sent a plan calling for a modest number of more troop back to his national security advisor. last week when president trump was asked about sending more troops he said we'll see. >>>a u.s. army soldier pictured kishe isis flag pleaded not guilty to supporting the group. he was indicted last friday. court documents claim he met with undercover fbi agents he believed were part of the terror group. he allegedly provided them

years in federal prison. arrested out the fort when he made the final connections on the device he believed would arm it. fort riley is the home of the armies first infran tri division. from the from the terrorism alert desk in washington i'm lindsy mastis. >> rick:  congressional democrats announced -- [inaudible] focusing on creating new job lowering healthcare costs and limiting corporate mergers. boris epstein a foreman trump campaign senior advisor and white house official provides commentary on the agenda and the possibility for by partisan support. >>  problems. we all have them. the first step to dealing with a problem is admitting it exists. it seems that the democrats are taking that first step. >>  when you lose an election with someone who has 40% popularity. you look in the mirror and say what did we do wrong. the number one thing we did wrong is we didn't tell people what we stood for. >>  the democrats do appear to learn from their losses in the 2016 presidential election. they understand they have largely fallen out of touch with american people. a recent abc news washington post poll found only 37% of americans think the democrat party stands for something. 5 # % says it's just stands against president trump. what does the democrat party to do? apparently it is to have a mix of ten senators and representatives drive 65 miles west of washington d.c. and announce a new plan. a better deal. better jobs better wages better future. yes the slogan may remind you of a pizza chain that rhymes with papa dons. >>  going passed the slogan there are some concrete policy proposals presented by the democrats. creating ten million jobs through apprenticeship program and tax incentives. lowering prescription drug prices. setting new tougher standards for corporate mergers. there are strong issues to focus on. the trump administration is already working on some of them. last month president trump signed an executive order to substantially increase the number of apprenticeship in the united states. the administration is working on plans to address the high cost of prescription drugs. slogans are great but democrats need to connect with the american people by action not words. movement on agenda items where the democrats actually agree with the white house would be a good start. some parts of the democrat better deal line up with the policies to have white house. so we could hope for concrete bipartisan achievement and not gridlock. that's the bottom line. >> kallie:  a shock robbering makes a discovery. the amazing fight alice cooper made in his storage and legendary artist this lost painting belongs to. we aren't the only ones collecting &-p>> kallie: wearen'tthe only ones collecting supplies with the tools for school program. >> rick:  reenforcing your faith in humanity. we talked to you about the story in johnson county kentucky. one teacher resorting to panhandling in the streets to get donations. sarah talked with a family who made a trek to support her cause. >>  she's come from ohio then. >>  yes. from ohio. >>  how cool is that. >>  one sign... is uniting educators across the nation. it was just last week that i introduced you to teacher teresa. as she begged for money so she could buy classroom supplies. the story and her genuine desire to help kids spread quickly. she received dozens of e-mails with messages of support and generous donations. and her go fund me account surpassed her expectations. but monday... >>  we were coming down. >>  was a surprise she never imagined. a mother and apyring teacher from ohio saw fox 23 story on fox news' website. >>  look what this lady is doing. >>  she was determined to meet her when her family passed through tulsa on their way to visit her inlaws in oklahoma city. >>  while we were driving i was looking for you on facebook. >>  and she made it happen. >>  from my family to you. we'd like to give you a hundred dollars for school supplies. >>  thank you so much. i love you. >>  thank you. >>  thank you for coming to see me. >>  a visit about much more than money. >> rick:  she also has a go fund me page which has already raised about $20000. money she wants to help other teachers to get their supplies. >> brandon: what a day today on this 25th of july. it felt more like late september early october. perhaps charleston made it up to 83. huntington 81. a little warm but the humidity was low. normal high should be 86. comfortable stuff. comfortable tonight. clear skies across the region. not tracking anything. it looks like that comfortable quiet weather will persist in towards the first half of tomorrow. in fact the gates open up there at jackson county fair at 7:30 in the morning. if you go early it's going to be comfortable in the upper 50s possibly fog out there. the afternoon is going to turn toasty. mid to upper 80s. still not terribly humid and most importantly it looks quiet. don't forget the sunscreen. might want to drink extra water too. that sun can work on you especially when temperatures reach the upper 80s. later in the 7-day forecast shower and thunderstorms to deal with. some could turn severe. i'll let you know which day we're expecting that coming up in a bit. >> rick:  the fourth and final wife of entertainment legend frank sinatra died. >> kallie:  inferenced say barbara sinatra passed away earlier today dying of natural causes. the sinatra were married 22 years until frank's death in 1998. with her husband's support she launched a name sake children center to help the

surrounded by atmospheres of red seems to be a party of electric chair images from the series death and disaster. other paintings from that series sold for more than $10 million. no word on how much this particular painting might go for. >>>the high school football season kicks into high gear next week with practices beginning monday. mountaineers hold their first practice on sunday but marshall gets a jump start on everyone. herd begins fall camp thursday afternoon. no shortage of motivation following last years unexpected 3-9 season. the herd fell short last year so the goal is to flip the script. the coaching staff has an idea of who will start at every position but a handful of spots are lock down. as they say the backups are only an injury away from becoming a starter. that's why competition is the crucial word. the keyword once those helmets are strapped up on thursday. >>  the competition is a greatest thing in the world. it brings out the best in everybody whether it's your business or our business. you like to compete and be a competitor. you like competition. you go out there and compete your tail off to make sure you keep that position. there's no doubt we've got more

are saying.      you're watching newschannel 12 on fox eastern carolina... senate republicans will z2f8lz zy6z y2f8ly yy6y move forward with their plans to repeal and replace obamacare.      this as the white house responds to growing reports president trump was speaking with advisors about firing his attorney general.     fox news correspondent ellison barber is in washington tonight with the latest. barber says: ""attorney general jeff sessions stealing some of the spotlight away from republican senator john mccain ... who just days after announcing he has an aggressive form of brain cancer returned to capitol hill today for a key vote on healthcare.""  trump says: ""this is the beginning of the end for the disaster known as obamacare"" after seven years of promising to repeal and replace obamacare - 50 republicans voted yes on a procedural motion to move forward with debate on repeal and replace legislation.  as expected every democrat voted no ... which forced vice president mike pence to step in as the tie breaker. one of the final yes votes came from senator john mccain ...who has been recovering from surgery at home in arizona ... but insisted on making it back to washington to cast his vote. mccain says: ""had so many people say such nice things about me recently that they might have me confused with someone else."" but it was attorney general jeff sessions overshadowing the highly anticipated senate health care vote.  this after sources tell the associated press president trump is seriously considering firing his longtime ally.  the president's frustration clearly  increasing ... calling sessions - quote ""weak"" on twitter this morning... as lawmakers on both side of the aisle we're quick to defend the former alabama senator ... blumenthal says: ""he represents the people // he did the right thing by recusing himself."" shelby says: ""sessions has a lot of support and respect on capitol hill.""barber  says: ""also in the hot seat today was president trump's son-in-law jared kushner -- who met with congressional lawmakers for a second day of testimony regarding his involvement with russian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign. in washington ellison barber fox news."" u.s. capitol police arrested nearly 100 protestors .. upset with today's vote. the bill is on its way to the senate floor .. but democrats say the battle isn't over yet.     democrats are united against the bill saying it would end health care coverage for millions of americans. <warren says: ""healthcare is a basic human right and we are here to fight for a basic human right. make no mistake we have lost an important battle today but we have not yet lost this war. the republicans have opened the door to repealing healthcare for millions of americans to raising the cost for millions more. we are here to fight that war we are here to fight back we will not be silenced we will make our voices heard.""> it's unclear what a final bill will look like. dozens gather once again outside congressman darrel issa's office in california. protesters and counter- protesters lining the street outside issa's vista office. denss against the republican were seen holding signs protesting healthcare repeal efforts --   while supporters were seen with signs in support of the congressman and the president. dueling demonstrations in the area

and out of hospital rooms... feeling ups and downs from endless rounds of chemotherapy and other treatment procedures. m. menne says: ""just knowing your child has cancer it's scary."" turning that fear into a fight the menne's decided to start collecting postcards for sully to cheer him up as his treatments continue.  they initially set out to get friends and family on social media to get sulley a post card from each of the 50 states.  but after that small wish went viral the mail hasn't stopped. from iceland to antarctica colorado even this note from soldiers based in qatar...  sulley is averaging a box of mail a day... some with just simple notes to say hello others with unique gifts  from unique places like patches and tokens...  some with personal stories and heartfelt notes from cancer survivors. s. menne says: ""and they talk about how they had cancer and how they got through it."" each piece of mail is completely different than the next but each piece filled with the same love. m. menne says: ""it really makes you realize that there are still so many good people in the world and it makes me feel loved and it makes my son feel loved.""s. menne says: ""it helps me a lot because it helps me know i can get through it and everything."" there's a new way for multiple sclerosis patients to get treatment..  where there will be only need to get medicine only twice a
